00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,958
Looking deeply inside nature,
译者：Amer Da'our审计员：Mhd Adnan Ayasso

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,071
through the magnifying glass of science,
深入自然

3
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:22,676
designers extract principles,
processes and materials
从科学的角度

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,815
that are forming the very basis
of design methodology.
设计师提取原则

5
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:32,328
From synthetic constructs
that resemble biological materials,
工艺与材料

6
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:35,719
to computational methods
that emulate neural processes,
构成设计方法的基础

7
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:38,208
nature is driving design.
相似的合成配方

8
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,200
Design is also driving nature.
生物材料

9
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:45,863
In realms of genetics, regenerative
medicine and synthetic biology,
匹配神经操作的计算系统

10
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:48,592
designers are growing novel technologies,
自然引领设计

11
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,693
not foreseen or anticipated by nature.
设计也指导自然

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,083
Bionics explores the interplay
between biology and design.
在遗传学，再生医学领域

13
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:02,002
As you can see, my legs are bionic.
和合成生物学

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,514
Today, I will tell human stories
of bionic integration;
设计师正在开发新技术

15
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:14,237
how electromechanics attached
to the body, and implanted inside the body
天生没有预料或预期

16
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:18,975
are beginning to bridge the gap
between disability and ability,
生物医学工程正在研究相互作用

17
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:23,808
between human limitation
and human potential.
在生物学与设计之间

18
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:27,363
Bionics has defined my physicality.
如您所见，我的腿很工业

19
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:30,680
In 1982, both of my legs were amputated
今天我要讲人类的故事

20
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,808
due to tissue damage from frostbite,
关于电子合并

21
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,084
incurred during
a mountain-climbing accident.
电子与人体的关系

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,537
At that time, I didn't
view my body as broken.
植入体内

23
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:44,758
I reasoned that a human being
can never be "broken."
它正在弥合差距

24
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,584
Technology is broken.
在无能与力量之间

25
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,742
Technology is inadequate.
在人的能力有限之间

26
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:56,096
This simple but powerful idea
was a call to arms,
和人类的潜力

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,627
to advance technology
for the elimination of my own disability,
生物电子学决定了我的身体能力

28
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:03,143
and ultimately, the disability of others.
1982年，我的腿被截肢

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,418
I began by developing specialized limbs
因为组织被霜冻损坏

30
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,903
that allowed me to return
to the vertical world
我有一次登山事故

31
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:11,394
of rock and ice climbing.
当时我没有看着我的身体

32
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:16,036
I quickly realized that the artificial
part of my body is malleable;
作为清障车

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,410
able to take on any form, any function --
我的结论是，人类

34
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,373
a blank slate for which to create,
它永远不会被摧毁

35
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:28,565
perhaps, structures that could extend
beyond biological capability.
技术下降

36
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,741
I made my height adjustable.
技术不合适

37
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:33,445
I could be as short as five feet
or as tall as I'd like.
这个想法很简单但是很强大

38
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,898
(Laughter)
这是一个邀请

39
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,272
So when I was feeling bad about myself,
诱导技术

40
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,133
insecure, I would jack my height up.
取消我的骨

41
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,038
(Laughter)
最后，其他人无能为力

42
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,259
But when I was feeling
confident and suave,
我开始发展专业派对

43
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:49,052
I would knock my height down a notch,
just to give the competition a chance.
它让我回来了

44
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:51,171
(Laughter)
到攀登石头和雪的垂直世界

45
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,298
(Applause)
我很快意识到假器官在我体内

46
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:56,591
Narrow-edged feet allowed me
to climb steep rock fissures,
灵活

47
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,217
where the human foot cannot penetrate,
它可以具有任何形状和功能

48
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:03,423
and spiked feet enabled me
to climb vertical ice walls,
作为可以制作的白页

49
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:06,320
without ever experiencing
muscle leg fatigue.
可以扩展的结构

50
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,589
Through technological innovation,
生物能力

51
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,454
I returned to my sport,
stronger and better.
它使我的身高可调

52
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:15,061
Technology had eliminated my disability,
我的年龄可以短到五英尺，也可以长到我喜欢的时间

53
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,427
and allowed me a new climbing prowess.
（笑声）

54
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:21,014
As a young man, I imagined a future world
where technology so advanced
当我为自己感到难过时

55
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:22,820
could rid the world of disability,
或缺乏信心，我会增加身高

56
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,940
a world in which neural
implants would allow
但是当我感到自信和说服时

57
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,613
the visually impaired to see.
稍微降低我的身高

58
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:31,359
A world in which the paralyzed
could walk, via body exoskeletons.
只是给竞争对手一个机会

59
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,423
Sadly, because of
deficiencies in technology,
（笑声）（掌声）

60
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,181
disability is rampant in the world.
纤细的楔形脚使我能够攀爬

61
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:39,213
This gentleman is missing three limbs.
陡峭的骨折

62
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,726
As a testimony to current technology,
he is out of the wheelchair,
人脚很难穿透

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,671
but we need to do a better job in bionics,
to allow, one day, full rehabilitation
带刺的脚使我得以攀爬

64
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,900
for a person with this level of injury.
垂直冰墙

65
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:57,455
At the MIT Media Lab, we've established
the Center for Extreme Bionics.
没有肌肉疲劳

66
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,027
The mission of the center
is to put forth fundamental science
通过技术创新，

67
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,887
and technological capability
我回到自己的运动中越来越强

68
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,658
that will allow the biomechatronic
and regenerative repair of humans,
科技消除了我的ac骨

69
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:12,603
across a broad range
of brain and body disabilities.
它给了我新的攀登能力

70
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:17,444
Today, I'm going to tell you
how my legs function, how they work,
作为一个年轻人，我设想了一个未来世界

71
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:20,746
as a case in point for this center.
技术非常复杂

72
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,897
Now, I made sure to shave
my legs last night,
从而摆脱阳imp的世界

73
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,868
because I knew I'd be showing them off.
允许神经植入的世界

74
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,341
(Laughter)
对于视力障碍者

75
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,595
Bionics entails the engineering
of extreme interfaces.
瘫痪者可以行走的世界

76
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:32,491
There's three extreme
interfaces in my bionic limbs:
通过外部结构

77
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:36,595
mechanical, how my limbs
are attached to my biological body;
不幸的是，由于缺乏技术

78
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:39,918
dynamic, how they move
like flesh and bone;
世界赤字猖ramp

79
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,832
and electrical, how they communicate
with my nervous system.
这个大师有四肢

80
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:45,102
I'll begin with mechanical interface.
作为对当前技术的证明

81
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:49,047
In the area of design,
we still do not understand
他从轮椅上站起来

82
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,947
how to attach devices
to the body mechanically.
但是我们需要在生物电子学上做出更大的努力

83
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,328
It's extraordinary to me
that in this day and age,
让一天完全康复

84
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,677
one of the most mature,
oldest technologies
对于如此受伤的人

85
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:03,097
in the human timeline, the shoe,
still gives us blisters.
我们位于麻省理工学院媒体实验室

86
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:04,578
How can this be?
极端生物电子学的枢纽

87
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:07,554
We have no idea how to attach
things to our bodies.
中心的使命

88
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:11,269
This is the beautifully
lyrical design work
是发展基础科学

89
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:13,714
of Professor Neri Oxman
at the MIT Media Lab,
技术能力将使

90
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:17,162
showing spatially varying
exoskeletal impedances,
用于人类的生物机电一体化和再生修复

91
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:21,200
shown here by color variation
in this 3D-printed model.
大规模

92
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:26,335
Imagine a future where clothing
is stiff and soft where you need it,
脑和身体残疾

93
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,889
when you need it, for optimal
support and flexibility,
今天我会告诉你如何操作我的腿

94
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,588
without ever causing discomfort.
以及如何运作

95
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:35,534
My bionic limbs are attached
to my biological body
我们在这个中心做的一个例子

96
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:39,620
via synthetic skins
with stiffness variations,
我昨晚一定要刮腿

97
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:43,264
that mirror my underlying
tissue biomechanics.
我知道我要给你看

98
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,533
To achieve that mirroring, we first
developed a mathematical model
仿生学需要独特的界面工程

99
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,105
of my biological limb.
我的电子终端中有三个独特的界面：

100
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,411
To that end, we used
imaging tools such as MRI,
机械接口，以及我的末端如何连接

101
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,999
to look inside my body,
用我的身体

102
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,728
to figure out the geometries
and locations of various tissues.
动态界面以及如何将其动态地移动

103
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:59,139
We also took robotic tools --
电子接口以及如何进行通讯

104
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:04,074
here's a 14-actuator circle
that goes around the biological limb.
随着我的神经系统

105
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,439
The actuators come in,
find the surface of the limb,
我将从机械接口开始

106
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,708
measure its unloaded shape,
在设计领域，我们还是不明白

107
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:11,383
and then they push on the tissues
如何将设备机械连接到人体

108
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:14,978
to measure tissue compliances
at each anatomical point.
今天不正常

109
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,789
We combine these imaging and robotic data
最成熟，最古老的技术之一

110
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:21,455
to build a mathematical description
of my biological limb, shown on the left.
在人类时代，这就是鞋子

111
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,233
You see a bunch of points, or nodes?
它仍然导致我们溃疡

112
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,407
At each node, there's a color
that represents tissue compliance.
怎么发生的？

113
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:30,373
We then do a mathematical transformation
to the design of the synthetic skin,
我们不知道事物如何附着在我们的身体上

114
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:31,596
shown on the right.
这是一件精美的作品

115
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:34,492
And we've discovered optimality is:
麻省理工学院实验室的Nery Oxman教授

116
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:37,373
where the body is stiff,
the synthetic skin should be soft,
显示各种外部结构成分

117
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,857
where the body is soft,
the synthetic skin is stiff,
在这里以不同的颜色显示

118
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:44,164
and this mirroring occurs
across all tissue compliances.
以这种3D打印形式

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,481
With this framework,
we've produced bionic limbs
想象一下衣服的未来

120
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:50,426
that are the most comfortable
limbs I've ever worn.
无论您需要什么，都可以用软硬

121
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:57,166
Clearly, in the future, our clothing,
our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,
当您需要完美的支持和灵活性时

122
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,846
will no longer be designed
and manufactured using artisan strategies,
完全不会造成不适

123
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,074
but rather, data-driven
quantitative frameworks.
我的电子器官连接到我的重要身体

124
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:08,302
In that future, our shoes
will no longer give us blisters.
由人造皮革制成

125
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,937
We're also embedding
sensing and smart materials
具有不同的刚度

126
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,532
into the synthetic skins.
那反映了我下层组织的生物力学

127
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:18,024
This is a material developed
by SRI International, California.
为了实现这种逆转

128
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:21,036
Under electrostatic effect,
it changes stiffness.
首先我们开发了一个算术模型

129
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,674
So under zero voltage,
the material is compliant,
对于我至关重要的聚会

130
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,072
it's floppy like paper.
为此，我们使用了MRI等成像工具

131
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:28,564
Then the button's pushed,
a voltage is applied,
让我们看看我的身体

132
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:30,580
and it becomes stiff as a board.
了解几何形状和位置

133
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,722
(Tapping sounds)
不同的组织

134
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,314
We embed this material
into the synthetic skin
我们还使用了机器人工具

135
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:39,447
that attaches my bionic limb
to my biological body.
这是14集的机械触发

136
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,318
When I walk here, it's no voltage.
围绕生命的终结

137
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,399
My interface is soft and compliant.
输入机械执行器并找到尖端的表面

138
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,414
The button's pushed,
voltage is applied, and it stiffens,
它测量其空心形式

139
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:50,454
offering me a greater maneuverability
over the bionic limb.
然后你去纸巾

140
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,751
We're also building exoskeletons.
测量组织相容性

141
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,583
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft
在每个解剖点

142
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,545
in just the right areas
of the running cycle,
我们收集这些机器人图像和信息

143
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,823
to protect the biological joints
from high impacts and degradation.
让我们建立一个算法

144
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,633
In the future, we'll all
be wearing exoskeletons
达到我至关重要的目标，如左图所示

145
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,942
in common activities, such as running.
您会看到一组点或节点

146
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,450
Next, dynamic interface.
在每个节点上都有代表组织相容性的颜色

147
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:12,982
How do my bionic limbs
move like flesh and bone?
然后我们进行帐户转帐

148
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:17,784
At my MIT lab, we study how humans
with normal physiologies
人造革设计

149
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:19,314
stand, walk and run.
如右图所示

150
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,729
What are the muscles doing,
我们发现理想是

151
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:23,126
and how are they controlled
by the spinal cord?
当身体结实时，人造革必须光滑

152
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,142
This basic science
motivates what we build.
当身体柔软时，人造革必须坚固

153
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,504
We're building bionic ankles,
knees and hips.
而这种逆转发生

154
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:31,044
We're building body parts
from the ground up.
通过符合所有组织

155
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:35,017
The bionic limbs that I'm wearing
are called BiOMs.
在这种情况下

156
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:38,995
They've been fitted
to nearly 1,000 patients,
我们制作了电子派对

157
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,981
400 of which have been
wounded U.S. soldiers.
这是最舒适的衣服

158
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,163
How does it work?
显然在未来

159
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,202
At heel strike, under computer control,
我们的衣服，鞋子和手镯

160
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,202
the system controls stiffness,
假肢不再设计

161
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,263
to attenuate the shock
of the limb hitting the ground.
它是使用工匠策略制作的

162
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:54,383
Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb
outputs high torques and powers
相反，数据推动了定量框架

163
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,762
to lift the person
into the walking stride,
在那个未来我们的鞋子

164
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,271
comparable to how muscles
work in the calf region.
再也不会引起起泡

165
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:04,826
This bionic propulsion is very important
clinically to patients.
我们还将传感器和智能材料相结合

166
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,904
So on the left, you see
the bionic device worn by a lady,
合成革

167
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,863
on the right, a passive device
worn by the same lady,
这种材料

168
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,713
that fails to emulate
normal muscle function,
由加利福尼亚州的斯坦福国际研究所开发

169
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:17,415
enabling her to do something
everyone should be able to do:
在电效应下，它会改变其硬度

170
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,214
go up and down their steps at home.
即使在零电压下，材料也不兼容

171
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:22,649
Bionics also allows
for extraordinary athletic feats.
像纸一样灵活

172
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,792
Here's a gentleman running
up a rocky pathway.
在按钮的压力下，施加电压

173
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,609
This is Steve Martin --
not the comedian --
像木板一样变硬

174
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,612
who lost his legs in a bomb blast
in Afghanistan.
我们将这些材料组合成人造革

175
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:39,194
We're also building exoskeletal
structures using these same principles,
将假肢连接到生物体

176
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:41,461
that wrap around the biological limb.
当你走到这里

177
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:47,522
This gentleman does not have
any leg condition, any disability.
没有有效电压

178
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,802
He has a normal physiology,
柔软且兼容的交互性

179
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:54,395
so these exoskeletons are applying
muscle-like torques and powers,
当按下按钮时，施加电压

180
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,119
so that his own muscles need not
apply those torques and powers.
然后变硬

181
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,477
This is the first exoskeleton in history
that actually augments human walking.
它为我提供了极大的可操作性

182
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,306
It significantly reduces metabolic cost.
在电子方面

183
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:10,382
It's so profound in its augmentation,
我们还建造外部结构

184
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:13,555
that when a normal, healthy person
wears the device for 40 minutes
这个外骨骼变得僵硬

185
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,278
and then takes it off,
仅在操作周期的正确区域

186
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:19,357
their own biological legs feel
ridiculously heavy and awkward.
为了保护生物关节

187
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,450
We're beginning the age in which
machines attached to our bodies
来自碰撞和割伤

188
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,484
will make us stronger
and faster and more efficient.
将来我们都会穿外部结构

189
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,446
Moving on to electrical interface:
在日常活动中，例如跑步

190
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,627
How do my bionic limbs communicate
with my nervous system?
接下来，动态界面

191
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,493
Across my residual limb are electrodes
我的电子四肢如何像骨肉一样运动？

192
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:37,262
that measure the electrical
pulse of my muscles.
在麻省理工学院媒体实验室，我们研究人类的行为

193
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,205
That's communicated to the bionic limb,
站立，散步和慢跑的博物学家

194
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:42,282
so when I think about moving
my phantom limb,
肌肉做什么

195
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:45,020
the robot tracks those movement desires.
脊髓如何控制它？

196
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,262
This diagram shows fundamentally
how the bionic limb is controlled.
基础科学支持建设过程

197
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,075
So we model the missing biological limb,
我们制造脚踝，膝盖和电子大腿

198
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,913
and we've discovered
what reflexes occurred,
我们还为整个身体打造四肢

199
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:59,278
how the reflexes of the spinal cord
are controlling the muscles.
我穿的四肢称为（BiOM）。

200
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:04,199
And that capability is embedded
in the chips of the bionic limb.
已为近1000位患者安装

201
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,969
What we've done, then, is we modulate
the sensitivity of the reflex,
其中有400个是为受伤的美国士兵安装的

202
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:12,088
the modeled spinal reflex,
with the neural signal,
如何运作？只要脚跟一脚掌就可以通过计算机进行控制

203
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:15,541
so when I relax my muscles
in my residual limb,
系统控制刚性

204
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:18,412
I get very little torque and power,
减少肢体撞击地面的影响

205
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:21,157
but the more I fire my muscles,
the more torque I get,
在手术过程中，四肢在抽水

206
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,593
and I can even run.
大功率高扭矩抬起人

207
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:28,958
And that was the first demonstration
of a running gait under neural command.
到台阶位置

208
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,134
Feels great.
后腿肌肉的运作方式

209
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:35,324
(Applause)
推动成员前进非常重要

210
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:37,534
We want to go a step further.
对于地面患者

211
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:40,605
We want to actually close the loop
在左侧，我们看到了电子终端

212
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,865
between the human
and the bionic external limb.
被女士磨损-在右侧

213
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:45,558
We're doing experiments
具有非智能派对的同一位女士

214
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:48,051
where we're growing nerves,
transected nerves,
它无法模拟自然肌肉的作用

215
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,105
through channels, or micro-channel arrays.
这门科学使她能够做某事

216
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,823
On the other side of the channel,
每个人都应该这样做

217
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:54,176
the nerve then attaches to cells,
它在房子的楼梯上下

218
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,108
skin cells and muscle cells.
这个标志也使我们的运动脚很棒

219
00:11:56,926 --> 00:12:01,046
In the motor channels, we can sense
how the person wishes to move.
在这里，我们看到一个人在岩石路上奔跑

220
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,707
That can be sent out wirelessly
to the bionic limb,
这是史蒂夫·马丁，不是喜剧演员

221
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:07,112
then [sensory information]
on the bionic limb
谁因阿富汗爆炸案而失去双腿

222
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:10,637
can be converted to stimulations
in adjacent channels,
我们也在建造室外建筑

223
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,894
sensory channels.
使用相同的原则

224
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:15,946
So when this is fully developed
and for human use,
通过用外部结构包裹重要器官

225
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,606
persons like myself will not only have
这个男人没有受苦

226
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,163
synthetic limbs that move
like flesh and bone,
他的脚有任何受伤或残疾

227
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:24,949
but actually feel like flesh and bone.
他的身体状况完好无损

228
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,177
This video shows Lisa Mallette,
拥有这些结构

229
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:30,852
shortly after being fitted
with two bionic limbs.
旋转力和运动像天然肌肉

230
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:34,964
Indeed, bionics is making
a profound difference in people's lives.
他的肌肉不需要做的地方

231
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,741
(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.
有任何力或扭矩

232
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,654
LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!
这是历史上第一个外部结构

233
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,121
(Video) (Laughter)
它模拟自然的人类行走

234
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:47,094
LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!
显着降低新陈代谢

235
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,831
Woman: Now, don't start running.
步行的发展量很大

236
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,649
Man: Now turn around,
and do the same thing walking up,
即使一个正常的人出现

237
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:57,402
but get on your heel to toe, like you
would normally just walk on level ground.
戴40分钟

238
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,252
Try to walk right up the hill.
然后脱掉

239
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:03,514
LM: Oh my God.
他觉得自己的脚是真实的

240
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:05,283
Man: Is it pushing you up?
沉重且极不平衡

241
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:10,262
LM: Yes! I'm not even --
I can't even describe it.
我们正处在时间的起点上

242
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:11,799
Man: It's pushing you right up.
它将使我们的机器连接到我们的身体

243
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:15,156
Hugh Herr: Next week,
I'm visiting the Center --
更快更强

244
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,332
Thank you. Thank you.
更有效

245
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:19,862
(Applause)
现在我们转向电气通信

246
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,169
Thank you.
我的四肢如何冒险

247
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:25,018
Next week I'm visiting the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
随着我的神经系统

248
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,645
and I'm going to try to convince CMS
在我腿的其余部分，我们看到了电极

249
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:30,224
to grant appropriate
code language and pricing,
它可以测量我的肌肉振动

250
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:33,979
so this technology can be made available
to the patients that need it.
这又会给机器人的两端带来风险

251
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,026
(Applause)
所以当我考虑移动它时

252
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,210
Thank you.
机器人应用您想到的动作

253
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:39,849
(Applause)
该图显示了原理

254
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:43,817
It's not well appreciated,
but over half of the world's population
如何控制此自动结束

255
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:48,608
suffers from some form of cognitive,
emotional, sensory or motor condition,
因此，我们应用缺少的自然肢体的运动

256
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:53,042
and because of poor technology,
too often, conditions result in disability
我们发现了发生的反应

257
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,701
and a poorer quality of life.
以及脊柱反应如何

258
00:13:55,113 --> 00:14:00,053
Basic levels of physiological function
should be a part of our human rights.
控制肌肉

259
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:04,033
Every person should have the right
to live life without disability
而这种能力融合

260
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,954
if they so choose --
在电子端芯片中

261
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,700
the right to live life
without severe depression;
我们已经做的是类似的

262
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:12,105
the right to see a loved one,
in the case of seeing-impaired;
响应灵敏度

263
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,018
or the right to walk or to dance,
类似的骨架反应

264
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:16,799
in the case of limb paralysis
or limb amputation.
随着神经信号

265
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:21,299
As a society, we can
achieve these human rights,
当我放松脚的其余部分的肌肉时

266
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:26,817
if we accept the proposition
that humans are not disabled.
我有一点旋转和力量

267
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:29,714
A person can never be broken.
但是我越努力地工作

268
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,175
Our built environment, our technologies,
我旋转得更多

269
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,074
are broken and disabled.
我什至可以跑步

270
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:38,476
We the people need not
accept our limitations,
这是第一场演出

271
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,197
but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.
用于由紧张命令控制的跑步

272
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:46,559
Indeed, through fundamental advances
in bionics in this century,
感觉很棒

273
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,741
we will set the technological foundation
for an enhanced human experience,
（鼓掌）

274
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,702
and we will end disability.
我们要向前迈进

275
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:57,011
I'd like to finish up
with one more story, a beautiful story.
我们渴望弥合差距

276
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,630
The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.
在人类和重要机械肢体之间

277
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,198
Adrianne lost her left leg
in the Boston terrorist attack.
我们正在做实验，我们可以

278
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:08,721
I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,
at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
通过其移除植入物

279
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:11,221
Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.
它以精致的车道形式穿过通道

280
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,858
Adrianne breathes and lives dance.
在频道的另一边

281
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,636
It is her expression. It is her art form.
神经与细胞沟通

282
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,659
Naturally, when she lost her limb
in the Boston terrorist attack,
皮肤细胞和肌肉细胞

283
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:22,850
she wanted to return to the dance floor.
通过这些渠道，我们可以感觉到

284
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,987
After meeting her
and driving home in my car,
一个人想参加的运动

285
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:29,864
I thought, I'm an MIT professor.
I have resources.
无线发送到自动化端

286
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,426
Let's build her a bionic limb,
然后可以将其转换

287
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,380
to enable her to go back
to her life of dance.
机器人末端的传感器可触及催化剂

288
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:38,872
I brought in MIT scientists
with expertise in prosthetics,
在相邻的感觉通道中

289
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,205
robotics, machine learning
and biomechanics,
因此，当所需的项目完成时

290
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:45,064
and over a 200-day research period,
we studied dance.
提供人类服务

291
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:49,286
We brought in dancers
with biological limbs,
像我这样的人不仅会喜欢它

292
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,945
and we studied how they move,
假肢像肉和骨头一样运动

293
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:55,142
what forces they apply on the dance floor,
相反，他们会感觉像他们的骨肉一样

294
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,693
and we took those data,
该视频显示了丽莎·马莱特

295
00:15:56,717 --> 00:16:00,492
and we put forth
fundamental principles of dance,
获得两个自动成员后立即

296
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,303
reflexive dance capability,
其实这些目的是

297
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,492
and we embedded that intelligence
into the bionic limb.
人们生活的巨大变化

298
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:09,737
Bionics is not only about making
people stronger and faster.
（视频）丽莎·马莱特：哦，天哪

299
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:15,173
Our expression, our humanity
can be embedded into electromechanics.
天哪，我不敢相信

300
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,296
It was 3,5 seconds between the bomb blasts
in the Boston terrorist attack.
我觉得我有脚！

301
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:27,296
In 3,5 seconds, the criminals and cowards
took Adrianne off the dance floor.
我的脚不要开始跑步

302
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,026
In 200 days, we put her back.
男人：现在转身

303
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:35,468
We will not be intimidated, brought down,
diminished, conquered or stopped
做同样的，走

304
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,037
by acts of violence.
在脚后跟和前脚上走到母鹿

305
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:43,997
(Applause)
好像您在弯曲的表面上行走

306
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,348
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me
to introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis,
尝试上山

307
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,602
her first performance since the attack.
丽莎：天哪

308
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,517
She's dancing with Christian Lightner.
男人：你把你推高了吗

309
00:16:54,541 --> 00:17:01,233
(Applause)
丽莎：是的！我不是...。我无法形容

310
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:11,694
(Music: "Ring My Bell"
performed by Enrique Iglesias)

311
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:58,037
(Applause)

00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,163

316
