00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,800
A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.
译者：Zeineb Trabelsi审核员：Shaimaa Kamal

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,096
I had just driven home,
几年前，我闯入我的房子。

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,656
it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,
我开车去我家

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,976
I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,
那是蒙特利尔冬天的午夜，

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,776
and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --
我正在拜访住在另一边的朋友杰夫。

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,896
and don't bother asking
if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
前廊的温度计比零低40。

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,376
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --
并且不要打扰自己，尝试知道它是华氏40度还是华氏度，

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,656
it was very cold.
零以下40度是一回事-

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,896
And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,
很冷。

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,176
I found I didn't have my keys.
站在前廊上时，我感觉到口袋在看起来，

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,296
In fact, I could see them
through the window,
我发现我的钥匙不在我身边。

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,416
lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.
实际上，我可以通过窗口看到它，

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,576
So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,
在您将它们放在餐桌上的桌子上。

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,176
and they were locked tight.
所以我赶紧试图打开所有的门窗，

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,343
I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,
所有人都紧闭。

16
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,696
but at midnight, it could take a while
for a locksmith to show up,
我曾想过向锁具制造商寻求帮助，所以至少我的手机在我身边。

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,880
and it was cold.
但是在深夜，可能需要一段时间才能到达，

18
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:03,136
I couldn't go back to my friend
Jeff's house for the night
天气很冷。

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,827
because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,
我无法回到我朋友杰夫的家和他过夜

20
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,090
and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.
因为我明天早上要去欧洲飞行

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,896
So, desperate and freezing cold,
我需要护照和书包。

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,536
I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,
所以我绝望了，感到寒冷的冻僵，

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,536
cleared out the shards of glass,
我发现一块大石头，用它砸了地下室的窗户

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,896
I crawled through,
您卸下了破碎的玻璃碎片

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,336
I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,
我爬过它

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,980
figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,
我发现了一块纸板，并用它覆盖了孔

27
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,776
I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.
我决定早上去机场的路上

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,277
This was going to be expensive,
我可以打电话给承包商，请他修理窗户

29
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,856
but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
会很贵的

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,040
so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.
但这也许比锁匠在深夜里要的要少

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,096
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training
所以我认为在这种情况下，我会做到的

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,216
and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.
我是一位训练有素的神经科学家

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,776
It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,
我对大脑在压力下的工作情况了解得很少

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,056
it modulates adrenaline levels
分泌激素皮质醇的地方，导致心律升高

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,560
and it clouds your thinking.
它组织肾上腺素水平

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,056
So the next morning,
它使您的思维混乱

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,536
when I woke up on too little sleep,
所以第二天早上

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,296
worrying about the hole in the window,
当我从几个小时起床时

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,096
and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,
担心窗户的缝隙

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,816
and the freezing temperatures,
而且我应该联系承包商

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,296
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
我的关注是因为温度非常低

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,856
and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,
除了即将在欧洲举行的会议

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,256
my thinking was cloudy,
而且你知道，在我心中所有这些皮质醇

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,696
but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.
我的想法分散了

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,216
(Laughter)
但是我不知道我是因为我的思想分散了

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,496
And it wasn't until I got
to the airport check-in counter,
（笑声）

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,776
that I realized I didn't have my passport.
直到我到达机场登记处，情况才如此

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,816
(Laughter)
那时我才意识到我忘记带护照了。

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,296
So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,
（笑声）

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,776
got my passport,
raced back to the airport,
所以我在下雪和寒冷的时候跑到那所房子，花了40分钟

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,616
I made it just in time,
带他来并迅速返回机场

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,879
but they had given away
my seat to someone else,
我在正确的时间到达

53
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,879
so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,
但是他们把我的座位给了别人

54
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:39,120
in a seat that wouldn't recline,
on an eight-hour flight.
所以我被困在厕所后面的飞机后面

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,336
Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.
在八个小时的旅程中未完全弯曲的座椅上

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,496
(Laughter)
好吧，我在八个小时里有很长的时间思考不睡觉

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,176
And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,
（笑声）

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,136
systems that I can put into place,
我开始怀疑，有什么我能做的吗？

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,616
that will prevent bad things
from happening?
必须安排到位

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,536
Or at least if bad things happen,
这可以防止坏事的发生

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,560
will minimize the likelihood
of it being a total catastrophe.
或至少发生坏事

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,936
So I started thinking about that,
它减少了完全灾难的可能性

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,818
but my thoughts didn't crystallize
until about a month later.
所以我开始考虑

64
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:07,536
I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
但是直到大约一个月后，我的想法才完全成型

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,936
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,
我和我的同事诺贝尔奖获得者丹尼·卡尼曼共进晚餐

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,376
and, you know, forgotten my passport,
我告诉他，我对库斯拉玻璃杯的故事感到有些尴尬

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,616
and Danny shared with me
你知道，忘记我的护照，

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,136
that he'd been practicing
something called prospective hindsight.
丹尼告诉我

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,896
(Laughter)
他正在接受所谓的预期后见之明的训练

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,063
It's something that he had gotten
from the psychologist Gary Klein,
（笑声）

71
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,136
who had written about it
a few years before,
这是他从心理学家加里·克莱恩那里学到的

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,256
also called the pre-mortem.
他几年前写的

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,233
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.
也称为死亡前

74
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,736
Whenever there's a disaster,
你们都知道死后意味着什么

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,056
a team of experts come in and they try
to figure out what went wrong, right?
灾难发生时

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,496
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
一个专家团队来找问题，对吗？

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,416
you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,
好吧，在死亡前阶段，丹尼解释道

78
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,016
and then you try to figure out
what you can do
您正在查看眼前的事物并试图找出问题所在

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,536
to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.
然后设法看看你能做什么

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,496
So what I want to talk to you about today
防止这些事情发生或限制其危害

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,056
are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.
这就是我今天要告诉你的

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,976
Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.
这是我们在赛前阶段可以做的事情

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,936
I'll start with the obvious ones.
其中有些很清楚，有些不是很清楚

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.
我先说清楚

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,536
Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,
在房子周围，找到容易迷路的地方

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,096
but there's a lot of science
to back this up,
这似乎合乎逻辑，并且

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,416
based on the way our spatial memory works.
但是有很多科学支持这一假设

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,296
There's a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,
取决于我们的空间记忆的工作方式

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,256
that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,
大脑中有一个区域称为海马体

90
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,056
to keep track of the locations
of important things --
那已经发展了几万年

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,496
where the well is,
where fish can be found,
跟踪重要事物的位置

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,016
that stand of fruit trees,
哪里有水，哪里有鱼

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,656
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
还有果树的地方

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,585
The hippocampus is the part of the brain
和平与敌对的部落住在哪里？

95
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,096
that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.
海马是大脑的一部分

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,816
It's the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
扩展到伦敦的出租车司机

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,698
And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment
这是让松鼠找到坚果的部分

98
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:47,496
where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
如果您想知道，有人真的尝试过

99
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,336
and they could still find their nuts.
他们使松鼠失去嗅觉的地方

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,176
They weren't using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,
但是，他们可以找到坚果

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,216
this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.
他们不是依靠嗅觉，而是利用海马体，

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,976
But it's really good for things
that don't move around much,
这种机制可以很好地发现事物

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,456
not so good for things that move around.
但这对于移动不多的东西很有用

104
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,776
So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.
不适合到处乱逛

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,296
So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --
这就是为什么您丢失车钥匙，老花镜和护照的原因

106
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,176
a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.
因此，您必须在家里找到钥匙的存放位置-

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,296
For your passport, a particular drawer.
在门上安装挂钩，或者在装饰碗上安装挂钩

108
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,096
For your reading glasses,
a particular table.
还有一个专门的护照抽屉

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,576
If you designate a spot
and you're scrupulous about it,
还有一张桌子，可以戴上老花镜

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,416
your things will always be there
when you look for them.
如果您指定一个地点并且您对此准确无误

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,656
What about travel?
搜索时，您会发现自己的东西就位

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,056
Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,
旅行时怎么办？

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,376
your driver's license, your passport,
用手机拍摄信用卡照片

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,656
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
以及驾照和护照

115
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,056
If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.
并将其发送到您在云计算中的电子邮件

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,696
Now these are some rather obvious things.
如果这些东西从您身上丢失或被盗，您可以轻松地交换它们

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,256
Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.
这些来自一些公理

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,496
Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.
请记住，当您承受压力时，大脑会分泌皮质醇

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,056
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem
皮质醇有毒，会使思维混乱

120
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,336
is to recognize that under stress
you're not going to be at your best,
这是赛前练习的一部分

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,656
and you should put systems in place.
意识到自己承受着压力不会尽力而为

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,616
And there's perhaps
no more stressful a situation
您应该安排必要的安排

123
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,056
than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to make.
没有引起焦虑的情况

124
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,376
And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,
不仅仅是您必须做出医疗决定

125
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,776
where we have to make
a very important decision
在某个时候，我们每个人都会面临这种情况

126
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,096
about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,
我们必须做出非常重要的决定

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,776
to help them with a decision.
关于未来的医疗或我们所爱的人

128
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,416
And so I want to talk about that.
帮助他们做出决定

129
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,456
And I'm going to talk about
a very particular medical condition.
这就是我想谈的

130
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,016
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
of medical decision-making,
我将谈论一种非常特殊的疾病

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,056
and indeed for financial decision-making,
and social decision-making --
但这似乎是所有医疗决策案例的文件

132
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,336
any kind of decision you have to make
实际上，在制定财务决策以及社交活动时，

133
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,376
that would benefit from a rational
assessment of the facts.
您应该做出什么样的决定？

134
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,536
So suppose you go to your doctor
and the doctor says,
谁可以从对事实的合理评估中受益

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,680
"I just got your lab work back,
your cholesterol's a little high."
假设你去看医生并告诉你

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,256
Now, you all know that high cholesterol
“我得到了分析结果，它表明胆固醇增加了”

137
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,416
is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,
我们都知道血液中的高胆固醇

138
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,856
heart attack, stroke.
它与心血管疾病的风险增加有关

139
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,096
And so you're thinking
心脏病发作

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,216
having high cholesterol
isn't the best thing,
因此，您相信

141
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,256
and so the doctor says,
"You know, I'd like to give you a drug
高胆固醇不是好事

142
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,056
that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin."
医生告诉你，“我想给你开药

143
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,976
And you've probably heard of statins,
这将有助于您降低胆固醇水平（他汀类药物）。

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,810
you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs
也许您之前听说过六十年代

145
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,008
in the world today,
您知道它是最常用的药物之一

146
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,111
you probably even know
people who take them.
在当今世界

147
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,516
And so you're thinking,
"Yeah! Give me the statin."
您可能知道带他们的人

148
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,976
But there's a question
you should ask at this point,
然后您开始思考，“是！给我他汀类药物。”

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,856
a statistic you should ask for
但是此时您应该问一个问题

150
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,336
that most doctors
don't like talking about,
您应该询问的统计数据

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,520
and pharmaceutical companies
like talking about even less.
大多数医生避免谈论

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,176
It's for the number needed to treat.
制药公司避免经常谈论它们

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,176
Now, what is this, the NNT?
这是要处理的号码

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,256
It's the number of people
that need to take a drug
现在我们是什么意思？

155
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,136
or undergo a surgery
or any medical procedure
需要服用药物的人数

156
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,536
before one person is helped.
或接受手术或任何医疗程序

157
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,416
And you're thinking,
what kind of crazy statistic is that?
帮助一个人之前

158
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,656
The number should be one.
您会问这些疯狂的统计数据是什么

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,736
My doctor wouldn't prescribe
something to me
结果应该是一个

160
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,045
if it's not going to help.
医生不会开任何药

161
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,553
But actually, medical practice
doesn't work that way.
如果对我没用

162
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,109
And it's not the doctor's fault,
但是，实际上，医疗实践并不遵循这种方法

163
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:46,053
if it's anybody's fault,
it's the fault of scientists like me.
这不是医生的错

164
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,942
We haven't figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.
如果这是某人的错，那将是像我一样的科学家的错

165
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:51,376
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates
我们还没有找到足够的基本机制

166
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,376
that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
但该公司估计葛兰素史克

167
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,216
So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,
90％的毒品为30-50％的人服务

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,376
what do you suppose it is?
因此，广泛描述了他汀类药物需要治疗的数量

169
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,216
How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?
您认为多少钱？

170
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,440
300.
帮助一个人之前他们必须吃多少人？

171
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,456
This is according to research
300名

172
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,976
by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
这是根据研究

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,776
independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
由研究人员Jerome Groppmann和Pamela Hartzband制造

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
I ran through the numbers myself.
它由Bloomberg.com独立安装

175
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,296
300 people have to
take the drug for a year
我自己检查了这些数字

176
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,296
before one heart attack, stroke
or other adverse event is prevented.
300人必须服药一年

177
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,701
Now you're probably thinking,
预防心脏病发作，中风或其他有害影响之前

178
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,536
"Well, OK, one in 300 chance
of lowering my cholesterol.
也许现在你会开始思考

179
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,776
Why not, doc? Give me
the prescription anyway."
“嗯，有机会降低我的胆固醇水平300

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,656
But you should ask at this point
for another statistic,
为什么不行，医生？反正写处方

181
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,256
and that is, "Tell me
about the side effects." Right?
但是在此阶段，您必须询问其他统计信息

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,936
So for this particular drug,
她告诉了我副作用，对吗？

183
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,616
the side effects occur
in five percent of the patients.
对于这种药

184
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,307
And they include terrible things --
在百分之五的患者中看到了副作用

185
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:47,775
debilitating muscle and joint pain,
gastrointestinal distress --
其中包括可怕的事情

186
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,658
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,
它们会影响肌肉，关节痛和消化道疼痛

187
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,696
not very likely
it's going to happen to me,
但是您会得到一个想法，“百分之五，

188
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,958
I'll still take the drug."
这不太可能发生在我身上

189
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,176
But wait a minute.
即使这样，我也会吃药。

190
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,536
Remember under stress
you're not thinking clearly.
等一下

191
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,725
So think about how you're going
to work through this ahead of time,
请记住，在压力下，您无法清晰地思考

192
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,948
so you don't have to manufacture
the chain of reasoning on the spot.
所以你应该事先考虑一下

193
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:05,465
300 people take the drug, right?
One person's helped,
您不必马上沉迷于一系列想法

194
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,896
five percent of those 300
have side effects,
300人吃药吧？已帮助1人

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,400
that's 15 people.
其中有5％患有副作用

196
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,696
You're 15 times more likely
to be harmed by the drug
相当于15个人

197
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,536
than you are to be helped by the drug.
您的伤害几率高出15倍

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,465
Now, I'm not saying whether you
should take the statin or not.
从他那里得到帮助

199
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,632
I'm just saying you should have
this conversation with your doctor.
我不是说你应该服用他汀类药物

200
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,976
Medical ethics requires it,
我的意思是你应该和你的医生进行对话

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,296
it's part of the principle
of informed consent.
医学伦理强加于此

202
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,536
You have the right to have access
to this kind of information
这是知情同意原则的一部分

203
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,456
to begin the conversation about whether
you want to take the risks or not.
您有权获得此类信息

204
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,696
Now you might be thinking
进行有关是否要冒险的对话

205
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,416
I've pulled this number
out of the air for shock value,
您可能会想到我是

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,696
but in fact it's rather typical,
this number needed to treat.
我突然把这个号码带给你

207
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,336
For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,
但实际上这有点典型，因为这个数字需要处理

208
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,576
removal of the prostate for cancer,
对50岁以上的男性进行了广泛的手术

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,176
the number needed to treat is 49.
谁根除前列腺癌

210
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,376
That's right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who's helped.
需要治疗的人数是49

211
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,056
And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.
没错，每个受助人都进行了49次手术

212
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,936
They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,
在这种情况下，有50％的患者出现了副作用

213
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,736
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,
它们包括阳ot和勃起功能障碍

214
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,216
fecal incontinence.
尿失禁和直肠裂缝

215
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,736
And if you're lucky, and you're one
of the 50 percent who has these,
大便通畅

216
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,800
they'll only last for a year or two.
如果幸运的话，您就是拥有此功能的50％的人之一

217
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,496
So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time
他们将生存一年或更长时间

218
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,056
to the questions
that you might be able to ask
因此，事前的想法是提前思考

219
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,456
that will push the conversation forward.
有问题你可以问

220
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,576
You don't want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.
这将使对话更上一层楼

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,496
And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.
您不必立即考虑所有这些问题

222
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,296
Because you have a choice oftentimes,
您还会想像生活质量之类的事情

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,616
do you I want a shorter life
that's pain-free,
因为大多数时候您都有选择权

224
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,416
or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?
您是否想要短暂而无痛苦的生活？

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,856
These are things to talk about
and think about now,
还是长寿，直到最后可能充满痛苦？

226
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,696
with your family and your loved ones.
您现在必须谈论和思考的事情

227
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,216
You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,
与您的家人和亲人

228
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,296
but at least you're practiced
with this kind of thinking.
您的看法可能会在激动中改变

229
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,936
Remember, our brain under stress
releases cortisol,
但是至少我练习过这种思维

230
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,296
and one of the things
that happens at that moment
请记住，大脑在压力下会分泌皮质醇

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,256
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
而此时发生的事情之一

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,185
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
一组工作已停止工作

233
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,616
Face-to-face with a predator,
you don't need your digestive system,
有一个进化的原因

234
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,096
or your libido, or your immune system,
与捕食者面对面时，不需要消化系统

235
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,776
because if you're body is expending
metabolism on those things
性欲或免疫系统

236
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,456
and you don't react quickly,
因为如果你的身体不代谢这些东西

237
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,456
you might become the lion's lunch,
and then none of those things matter.
而且不要对此事迅速回应

238
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,896
Unfortunately,
它可能成为狮子的食物，然后这些都不重要

239
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,536
one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress
不幸的是

240
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,536
is rational, logical thinking,
压力时期可能消散的一件事

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,976
as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.
这是理性和逻辑的思考

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,176
So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead
正如Danny Kahneman和他的同事所展示的

243
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,456
to these kinds of situations.
所以我们需要训练自己思考

244
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,656
I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
在这种情况下

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,536
We all are going to fail now and then.
我认为这里的重点是要认识到我们每个人都有缺陷

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,176
The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,
我们都会不时失败。

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,096
to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,
想法是提前考虑这些失败是什么

248
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,640
or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.
做出可能有助于您减少损失的安排

249
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,936
Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,
或者从一开始就防止坏事发生

250
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,696
when I got back from my trip,
我们回到蒙特利尔的那个下雪的夜晚

251
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,576
I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,
当我从飞机上回来时

252
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,136
with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.
承包商在门旁边安装了谐波锁

253
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,376
And I have to admit,
它装有前门钥匙，易于记住数字

254
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,816
I still have piles of mail
that haven't been sorted,
我必须承认

255
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,416
and piles of emails
that I haven't gone through.
我还有一堆尚未分类的邮件

256
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,216
So I'm not completely organized,
还有一堆我从未见过的电子邮件

257
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,376
but I see organization
as a gradual process,
所以我完全杂乱无章

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,616
and I'm getting there.
但我认为监管是一个渐进的过程

259
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,856
Thank you very much.
我会的。

260
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,272
(Applause)
非常感谢

261


（鼓掌）
