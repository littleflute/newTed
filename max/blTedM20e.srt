1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,800
A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,096
I had just driven home,

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,656
it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,976
I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,776
and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,896
and don't bother asking
if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,376
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,656
it was very cold.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,896
And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,176
I found I didn't have my keys.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,296
In fact, I could see them
through the window,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,416
lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,576
So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,176
and they were locked tight.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,343
I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,

16
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:56,696
but at midnight, it could take a while
for a locksmith to show up,

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,880
and it was cold.

18
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:03,136
I couldn't go back to my friend
Jeff's house for the night

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,827
because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,

20
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,090
and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,896
So, desperate and freezing cold,

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,536
I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,536
cleared out the shards of glass,

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,896
I crawled through,

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,336
I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,980
figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,

27
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,776
I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,277
This was going to be expensive,

29
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,856
but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,040
so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,096
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,216
and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,776
It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,056
it modulates adrenaline levels

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,560
and it clouds your thinking.

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,056
So the next morning,

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,536
when I woke up on too little sleep,

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,296
worrying about the hole in the window,

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,096
and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,816
and the freezing temperatures,

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,296
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,856
and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,256
my thinking was cloudy,

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,696
but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,216
(Laughter)

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,496
And it wasn't until I got
to the airport check-in counter,

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,776
that I realized I didn't have my passport.

48
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,816
(Laughter)

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,296
So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,776
got my passport,
raced back to the airport,

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,616
I made it just in time,

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,879
but they had given away
my seat to someone else,

53
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,879
so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,

54
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:39,120
in a seat that wouldn't recline,
on an eight-hour flight.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,336
Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,496
(Laughter)

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,176
And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,136
systems that I can put into place,

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,616
that will prevent bad things
from happening?

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,536
Or at least if bad things happen,

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,560
will minimize the likelihood
of it being a total catastrophe.

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,936
So I started thinking about that,

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,818
but my thoughts didn't crystallize
until about a month later.

64
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:07,536
I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,936
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,376
and, you know, forgotten my passport,

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,616
and Danny shared with me

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,136
that he'd been practicing
something called prospective hindsight.

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,896
(Laughter)

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,063
It's something that he had gotten
from the psychologist Gary Klein,

71
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,136
who had written about it
a few years before,

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,256
also called the pre-mortem.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,233
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.

74
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,736
Whenever there's a disaster,

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,056
a team of experts come in and they try
to figure out what went wrong, right?

76
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,496
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,416
you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,

78
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,016
and then you try to figure out
what you can do

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,536
to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,496
So what I want to talk to you about today

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,056
are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,976
Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,936
I'll start with the obvious ones.

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,536
Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,096
but there's a lot of science
to back this up,

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,416
based on the way our spatial memory works.

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,296
There's a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,256
that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,

90
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,056
to keep track of the locations
of important things --

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,496
where the well is,
where fish can be found,

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,016
that stand of fruit trees,

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,656
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,585
The hippocampus is the part of the brain

95
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,096
that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,816
It's the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,698
And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment

98
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:47,496
where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,

99
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,336
and they could still find their nuts.

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,176
They weren't using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,216
this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,976
But it's really good for things
that don't move around much,

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,456
not so good for things that move around.

104
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,776
So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,296
So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --

106
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,176
a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,296
For your passport, a particular drawer.

108
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,096
For your reading glasses,
a particular table.

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,576
If you designate a spot
and you're scrupulous about it,

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,416
your things will always be there
when you look for them.

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,656
What about travel?

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,056
Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,376
your driver's license, your passport,

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,656
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.

115
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,056
If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,696
Now these are some rather obvious things.

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,256
Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,496
Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,056
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem

120
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,336
is to recognize that under stress
you're not going to be at your best,

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,656
and you should put systems in place.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,616
And there's perhaps
no more stressful a situation

123
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,056
than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to make.

124
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,376
And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,

125
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,776
where we have to make
a very important decision

126
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,096
about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,776
to help them with a decision.

128
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,416
And so I want to talk about that.

129
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,456
And I'm going to talk about
a very particular medical condition.

130
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,016
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
of medical decision-making,

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,056
and indeed for financial decision-making,
and social decision-making --

132
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,336
any kind of decision you have to make

133
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,376
that would benefit from a rational
assessment of the facts.

134
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,536
So suppose you go to your doctor
and the doctor says,

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,680
"I just got your lab work back,
your cholesterol's a little high."

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,256
Now, you all know that high cholesterol

137
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,416
is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,

138
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,856
heart attack, stroke.

139
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,096
And so you're thinking

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,216
having high cholesterol
isn't the best thing,

141
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,256
and so the doctor says,
"You know, I'd like to give you a drug

142
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,056
that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin."

143
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,976
And you've probably heard of statins,

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,810
you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs

145
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,008
in the world today,

146
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,111
you probably even know
people who take them.

147
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,516
And so you're thinking,
"Yeah! Give me the statin."

148
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,976
But there's a question
you should ask at this point,

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,856
a statistic you should ask for

150
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,336
that most doctors
don't like talking about,

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,520
and pharmaceutical companies
like talking about even less.

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,176
It's for the number needed to treat.

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,176
Now, what is this, the NNT?

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,256
It's the number of people
that need to take a drug

155
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,136
or undergo a surgery
or any medical procedure

156
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,536
before one person is helped.

157
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,416
And you're thinking,
what kind of crazy statistic is that?

158
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,656
The number should be one.

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,736
My doctor wouldn't prescribe
something to me

160
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,045
if it's not going to help.

161
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:41,553
But actually, medical practice
doesn't work that way.

162
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,109
And it's not the doctor's fault,

163
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:46,053
if it's anybody's fault,
it's the fault of scientists like me.

164
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,942
We haven't figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.

165
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:51,376
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates

166
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,376
that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.

167
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,216
So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,

168
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,376
what do you suppose it is?

169
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,216
How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?

170
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,440
300.

171
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,456
This is according to research

172
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,976
by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,776
independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
I ran through the numbers myself.

175
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,296
300 people have to
take the drug for a year

176
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,296
before one heart attack, stroke
or other adverse event is prevented.

177
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,701
Now you're probably thinking,

178
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,536
"Well, OK, one in 300 chance
of lowering my cholesterol.

179
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,776
Why not, doc? Give me
the prescription anyway."

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,656
But you should ask at this point
for another statistic,

181
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,256
and that is, "Tell me
about the side effects." Right?

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,936
So for this particular drug,

183
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,616
the side effects occur
in five percent of the patients.

184
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,307
And they include terrible things --

185
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:47,775
debilitating muscle and joint pain,
gastrointestinal distress --

186
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,658
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,

187
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,696
not very likely
it's going to happen to me,

188
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,958
I'll still take the drug."

189
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,176
But wait a minute.

190
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,536
Remember under stress
you're not thinking clearly.

191
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,725
So think about how you're going
to work through this ahead of time,

192
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,948
so you don't have to manufacture
the chain of reasoning on the spot.

193
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:05,465
300 people take the drug, right?
One person's helped,

194
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,896
five percent of those 300
have side effects,

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,400
that's 15 people.

196
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,696
You're 15 times more likely
to be harmed by the drug

197
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,536
than you are to be helped by the drug.

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,465
Now, I'm not saying whether you
should take the statin or not.

199
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,632
I'm just saying you should have
this conversation with your doctor.

200
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,976
Medical ethics requires it,

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,296
it's part of the principle
of informed consent.

202
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,536
You have the right to have access
to this kind of information

203
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,456
to begin the conversation about whether
you want to take the risks or not.

204
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,696
Now you might be thinking

205
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,416
I've pulled this number
out of the air for shock value,

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,696
but in fact it's rather typical,
this number needed to treat.

207
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,336
For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,

208
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,576
removal of the prostate for cancer,

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,176
the number needed to treat is 49.

210
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,376
That's right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who's helped.

211
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,056
And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.

212
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,936
They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,

213
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,736
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,

214
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,216
fecal incontinence.

215
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,736
And if you're lucky, and you're one
of the 50 percent who has these,

216
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,800
they'll only last for a year or two.

217
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,496
So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time

218
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,056
to the questions
that you might be able to ask

219
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,456
that will push the conversation forward.

220
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,576
You don't want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,496
And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.

222
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,296
Because you have a choice oftentimes,

223
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,616
do you I want a shorter life
that's pain-free,

224
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,416
or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,856
These are things to talk about
and think about now,

226
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,696
with your family and your loved ones.

227
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,216
You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,

228
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,296
but at least you're practiced
with this kind of thinking.

229
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,936
Remember, our brain under stress
releases cortisol,

230
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,296
and one of the things
that happens at that moment

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,256
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,185
There's an evolutionary reason for this.

233
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,616
Face-to-face with a predator,
you don't need your digestive system,

234
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,096
or your libido, or your immune system,

235
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,776
because if you're body is expending
metabolism on those things

236
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,456
and you don't react quickly,

237
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,456
you might become the lion's lunch,
and then none of those things matter.

238
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,896
Unfortunately,

239
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,536
one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress

240
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,536
is rational, logical thinking,

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,976
as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,176
So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead

243
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,456
to these kinds of situations.

244
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,656
I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,536
We all are going to fail now and then.

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,176
The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,096
to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,

248
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,640
or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.

249
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,936
Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,

250
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,696
when I got back from my trip,

251
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,576
I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,

252
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,136
with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.

253
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,376
And I have to admit,

254
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,816
I still have piles of mail
that haven't been sorted,

255
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,416
and piles of emails
that I haven't gone through.

256
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,216
So I'm not completely organized,

257
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,376
but I see organization
as a gradual process,

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,616
and I'm getting there.

259
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,856
Thank you very much.

260
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,272
(Applause)
