Translator: Ahmed Gamal Auditor: Ayman Mahmoud

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,210
Chris Anderson: Elon, welcome back to TED.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,446
It's great to be here.

4
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,210
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,266
So, for about the next half hour,

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,070
We will spend some time

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,026
In exploring your vision of what an exciting future might look like,

8
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:31,136
And that, I think, would make the first question a little comic

9
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:32,906
Why do you dig?

10
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:34,136
Yes.

11
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:36,630
I ask myself this question a lot.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,226
We're trying to dig a hole down the city of Los Angeles,

13
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:46,446
In order to start the beginning

14
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,540
Why we hope it will be a 3D tunnel network

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,586
To reduce congestion.

16
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:59,120
Currently, one of the most frustrating things is traffic.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,056
It affects people all over the world.

18
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:05,876
Much of your life is lost.

19
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:07,840
This is terrible.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,506
Especially in Los Angeles.

21
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:12,186
(Laughter)

22
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:14,176
I think you brought it with you

23
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:16,625
The first visualization will be shown.

24
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,976
Can I show it?

25
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:20,686
Yes, of course, this is the first time ...

26
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:22,560
Just to clarify what we are talking about.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,796
There are a few important basic things

28
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:28,590
To create a 3D tunnel network.

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,170
First, you must be able

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,566
On merging the entrance and exit of the tunnel

31
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,656
Seamlessly with the architecture of the city.

32
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:38,344
By elevator,

33
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:43,126
Something like a car platform on an elevator

34
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:47,096
You will be able to integrate the inlet and outlet with the tunnel network

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,670
Using only two parking spaces.

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,760
Then the car is placed on a platform.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,176
There is no top speed;

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:59,216
So we design this to work at speeds equal to 200 kilometers per hour.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,406
How many?

40
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:04,900
200 km per hour, or about 130 miles per hour.

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,830
That is, you will be able to go, for example, from Westwood to Los Angeles Airport

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,146
In 6 minutes .. 5 to 6 minutes.

43
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:17,450
(clap)

44
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,720
So maybe in the beginning

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,446
It will resemble a pathway with charging points.

46
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,370
Yes.

47
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,746
Which I think will relieve some of the crowding

48
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,420
On the surface roads as well.

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,146
I don’t know if you noticed this in the video,

50
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:34,230
But there is no limit to the number of tunnels levels that can be reached.

51
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,106
You can go deeper than you can get up.

52
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:41,290
The deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings.

53
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,540
So you can reduce any random level of urban congestion

54
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,946
Using the tunnels network.

55
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:49,456
This is a very important point.

56
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:55,690
One of the main drawbacks of tunnels is that if you add a layer of tunnels

57
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,656
Just to reduce congestion, the void will be exhausted,

58
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,966
And you will return back to where you started, to congestion again.

59
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,436
But you can reach any number of tunnels,

60
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,786
And any number of levels.

61
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,230
But people think that drilling is usually very expensive;

62
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,246
This would end this idea.

63
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:12,690
Yes.

64
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,106
Well, they are right.

65
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:17,906
To give you an example, the Los Angeles subway stretch,

66
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,556
Which I think spanned 2,5 miles.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,813
It was created at a cost of $ 2 billion.

68
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:29,256
That's about a billion dollars a mile, to build the Los Angeles subway line.

69
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,250
This is not the most beneficial underground line in the world.

70
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,750
So yeah, tunneling is usually very difficult.

71
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,986
I think we should get at least a tenth

72
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:43,300
Of the cost of digging a mile.

73
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,100
How can you achieve this?

74
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,156
In fact, if you only do two things,

75
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:53,476
Then you can reduce the cost to about a tenth

76
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,706
And I think you can go beyond that.

77
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:59,976
The first thing to do is to reduce the diameter of the tunnel

78
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,606
For half or less.

79
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:05,596
The tunnel needed for a one-lane road, in accordance with the laws,

80
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,536
Diameter must be 26 feet and perhaps 28 feet;

81
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:11,676
To accommodate accidents and emergency vehicles,

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,950
And to allow adequate ventilation for combustion engines.

83
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,606
But if you reduce this diameter to the one we seek,

84
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,416
It's 12 feet, that's more than enough to hold an electric platform,

85
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,506
You will reduce the diameter in half,

86
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:30,300
And the cross-sectional area of ​​the strip to the fourth,

87
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,980
The cost of drilling is related to the cross-sectional area;

88
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,030
This means that the cost has been reduced to nearly one-fifth so far.

89
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,420
In addition, tunnel boring machines currently operate for half the time and then stop,

90
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,666
The rest of the time is spent adding reinforcements

91
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,966
For the tunnel wall.

92
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,190
So if you design the machine

93
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,540
To drill and reinforce continuously;

94
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,800
Doing this will cut your cost in half.

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,136
Add it to the above and you will reach the price.

96
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:59,786
Also, the machines will be far from reaching their maximum energy and thermal limits,

97
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:02,790
So you can greatly increase the machine power.

98
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,916
I think you can cut the cost by at least half and maybe a quarter or a half,

99
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,246
In addition to the above.

100
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:13,476
So I think there are a number of direct steps enough

101
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:16,240
To reach a value less than one tenth

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,226
From the cost of digging a mile,

103
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:21,136
Our goal now is ...

104
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,890
We have a pet snail called "Gary,"

105
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,626
It's the snail Gary from the South Park series,

106
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,846
Sorry, I mean "SpongeBob SquarePants".

107
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:31,096
(Laughter)

108
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,526
Gary can ...

109
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:39,636
Currently it can walk 14 times faster

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,536
From the tunnel boring machine.

111
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,236
(Laughter)

112
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,030
You want to defeat Gary.

113
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,596
We want to defeat Gary.

114
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:48,926
(Laughter)

115
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:51,156
It is an impatient boy,

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,306
This will make it a victory.

117
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,230
Victory is the defeat of the snail.

118
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,150
But many who imagine and dream about the cities of the future,

119
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,206
They think that the solution is flying cars, drones ... etc.

120
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,300
To go above the ground.

121
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,150
Why isn't this a better solution?

122
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,186
You will save all the costs of digging the tunnels.

123
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,416
Right, I prefer flying things.

124
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,336
I obviously are making missiles, so I love things that fly.

125
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:19,326
This is not a subjective bias against flying objects,

126
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:22,336
But there is a challenge facing flying cars

127
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,666
Which is that it would be very annoying,

128
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,120
And that the wind loads generated will be very high.

129
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,546
Let's just say that something is flying over your head,

130
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:38,260
That a group of cars is flying overhead,

131
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,926
This will not be a reassuring situation.

132
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,220
(Laughter)

133
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,440
You wouldn't say to yourself, "Okay, I have a better feeling about this day."

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,126
But you will ask, "Did they maintain the wheel covers,

135
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,916
Or will it fly and cut off my head? "

136
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,680
things like that.

137
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,756
So you have that vision

138
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:07,076
For future cities where these dense three-dimensional networks of tunnels are located beneath them.

139
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,096
Does this have anything to do with Hyperloop?

140
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,630
Can you use these tunnels to achieve the idea of ​​Hyperloop?

141
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,731
That I announced a few years ago.

142
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,860
Well, we were kind of having fun

143
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,486
On the topic of hyperlinks for a while.

144
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:24,376
We built a hyperlink demo next to SpaceX;

145
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,510
For student competition only;

146
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,576
To encourage innovative ideas in transport.

147
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:34,806
In fact, he ended up becoming the largest vacuum chamber in the world

148
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:36,970
After the Large Hadron Collider

149
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,880
according to size.

150
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,636
It was very fun to do, but it was like a hobby,

151
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:50,626
Then we thought we might ...

152
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:54,650
We built a small driving car to drive student capsules,

153
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,286
We will try to determine the speed with which we can make the driving car

154
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,829
When you pay nothing.

155
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,800
So we are cautiously optimistic

156
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,946
We will be able to make it faster than the world's fastest "bullet train"

157
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:13,686
Even in the 0,8 mile range.

158
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:14,796
Good brakes.

159
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:17,010
Yes, it is.

160
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,620
Either it will smash into small pieces or go too fast.

161
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,270
But you can imagine Hyperloop inside a tunnel

162
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,146
Going too long.

163
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:28,830
exactly.

164
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,716
Looking at the tunnel technology,

165
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,226
Turns out to be a tunnel,

166
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,420
You must..

167
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,566
In order to isolate it against the water table,

168
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:43,200
You will usually have to design a tunnel wall to withstand it

169
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,810
About 5 or 6 times the atmospheric pressure.

170
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,006
Reaching the void means one air pressure,

171
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,466
Or close to emptiness.

172
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:55,876
In fact, it turns out to be automatic,

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,896
If you create a tunnel well enough to resist the water table,

174
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:02,436
It will automatically be able to withstand discharge.

175
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:03,950
OK.

176
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,480
So, yes.

177
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,426
So you really are able to visualize

178
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:13,116
How long does Elon need in the future to operate the Hyperloop?

179
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,350
I think there is no maximum length.

180
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,380
You can dig as much as you want.

181
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,650
I think if you want to do something

182
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,670
Like Hyperloop from Washington to New York,

183
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,210
You would often prefer the entire path to be underground.

184
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,350
Because it is a high density area.

185
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,420
You will pass under a lot of buildings and houses,

186
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,146
And if you dig deep enough,

187
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:39,210
You will not be able to spot the tunnel.

188
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,330
Sometimes people think, it will be very annoying

189
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,296
There is a tunnel dug under their homes.

190
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:45,590
If this tunnel was dug

191
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,886
3 or 4 times the diameter of the tunnel under your home,

192
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:52,660
You will not be able to detect it during drilling at all.

193
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,750
In fact, if you can monitor the tunnel while digging it,

194
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,940
Whatever device you use,

195
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,200
You can get a lot of money in exchange for it from the Israeli army,

196
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,326
Who tries to monitor the tunnels of Hamas,

197
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:12,296
And from the US Customs and Border Protection that is trying to monitor drug smuggling tunnels.

198
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:15,490
So the reality is

199
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,340
That the Earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations,

200
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,416
Once the tunnel depth is below a certain level,

201
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,060
It becomes unrecoverable.

202
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,950
Maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic device,

203
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,540
You may be able to monitor it.

204
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,516
She founded a new company to do so

205
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:33,236
It is called the Drilling Company.

206
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,216
Very good, very funny.

207
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,560
(Laughter)

208
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,156
What's so funny about that?

209
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:40,746
(Laughter)

210
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:42,670
How long does this take your time?

211
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,540
Probably..

212
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,750
2 or 3 percent.

213
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,550
I bought a hobby.

214
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,356
This is what Elon Musk's hobbies look like.

215
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,386
(Laughter)

216
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,876
It really is, for example ...

217
00:10:56,876 --> 00:11:02,010
Basically it is the trainees and people who work part-time.

218
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,866
We bought some used machines.

219
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:11,210
It's kinda fun, but it's making good progress.

220
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,500
So there is a greater part of your time

221
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,310
You spend it on cars and electric transport through Tesla.

222
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,866
Is one of the motives of the tunnels project

223
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:24,370
Is to realize that in reality,

224
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,860
In a world where cars are electric and self-driving,

225
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,320
It may lead to more cars on the road

226
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,936
What time is it compared to the current time?

227
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:35,740
Yes, exactly.

228
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,186
Many people think that when cars are self-driving,

229
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:46,816
It will be faster and this will reduce traffic congestion

230
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,680
This is true to some degree.

231
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,886
But once shared autonomous driving is available, it is much cheaper to drive

232
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:56,830
And you can move from one point to another,

233
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,910
The cost of transportation by car will be better than the cost of transport by bus.

234
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,266
It will cost less than a bus ticket.

235
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:09,286
Therefore, driving rates will become much higher in the presence of shared self-driving,

236
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:12,166
In fact, traffic will get worse.

237
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:16,380
You founded Tesla to persuade the world

238
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,506
That electric power is the future of cars,

239
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,066
A few years ago, people were making fun of you.

240
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,466
Now, not much.

241
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:25,706
OK.

242
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,676
(Laughter)

243
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,870
I do not know. I do not know.

244
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,300
But isn't it true that almost all auto manufacturers

245
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,426
They have announced serious plans to rely on electricity

246
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,860
In the near and medium future.

247
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,020
Yes. Yes.

248
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,970
I think all auto manufacturers have a program for electric vehicles.

249
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,436
They differ in how serious they are.

250
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,716
Some are very serious about completely switching to electricity.

251
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:56,060
Some just have fun.

252
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,546
And some still surprisingly support fuel cells,

253
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,706
But I think that will not last long.

254
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,796
But doesn't it make sense, Elon?

255
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:07,516
Now simply declare your victory, and say "We have done it."

256
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:12,360
And you let the world go to electricity, and you go to focus on other things?

257
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,540
OK.

258
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,746
I intend to stay in Tesla in the future as much as I can imagine.

259
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:25,230
There are many exciting things that we will release.

260
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,706
It is clear that "Model 3" will be launched soon.

261
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,020
We will unveil the Tesla Half Truck.

262
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,906
Well, we'll mention that.

263
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:38,870
“Model 3” is slated to launch around July.

264
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,476
Yes, it seems very appropriate that we start production in July.

265
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:44,866
Gorgeous.

266
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,346
One of the things people get excited about

267
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:50,460
It is having an automatic driving mode in it.

268
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,840
You posted this video a while ago

269
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,190
Explain what this technology will look like.

270
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,900
Yes.

271
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,026
Obviously, there is an auto driving mode on the “S Model” now.

272
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,406
What do we see here?

273
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:09,310
This is done using cameras and GPS only

274
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,006
There are no "ledar" or radar systems used here.

275
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:17,020
This is done using only the "passive optical network," which is what people mainly use.

276
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,526
The entire road is explored

277
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,616
By using "passive optical network" or cameras,

278
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,986
And as soon as it processes the cameras data

279
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,220
Or vision,

280
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,056
Automated driving becomes possible.

281
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:34,050
If you cannot treat the vision, it will not be possible.

282
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,950
And so our focus is very much on getting a neural vision network

283
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,170
Very effective for road conditions.

284
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,580
Many others tend to use "Lidar".

285
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,710
All you need are cameras and radar.

286
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,176
You can undoubtedly be super using only cameras.

287
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:55,046
You can probably be ten times better than humans,

288
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:56,170
Only with cameras.

289
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,910
Cars currently sold with 8 cameras.

290
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,306
She cannot do what is shown here yet.

291
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:07,300
When will you be able to?

292
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,996
I think we are still on the right path to make it able to walk across the country

293
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:18,422
From Los Angeles to New York at the end of the year, fully automated driving.

294
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:21,970
Well then you're saying that by the end of the year,

295
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,036
Someone will sit in a Tesla car without touching the wheel,

296
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:28,546
Then click on New York and then go.

297
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:29,280
Yes.

298
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,980
He will never need to touch the wheel ... by the end of 2017.

299
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,700
Yes. Basically, in November or December this year,

300
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,140
We should be able to block the road from a California parking lot

301
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,956
To a parking lot in New York,

302
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:48,030
Without any directions at any point during the trip.

303
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,666
(clap)

304
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,600
just awesome.

305
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,346
But part of that is possible.

306
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:56,936
Because you already have a fleet of Tesla cars that travels all of these roads.

307
00:15:56,936 --> 00:16:01,790
It collects a huge amount of data on the local road system.

308
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,946
Yeah, but what might sound exciting

309
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:11,080
Is that I am really very confident that she can go this way,

310
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,710
Even if you use variable paths on this path.

311
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,060
Very easy ..

312
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,626
If you can be very good on a specific track then this is another matter.

313
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:28,630
But she must be able to walk very efficiently,

314
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,646
Especially when you're on the highway,

315
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:33,456
To go anywhere on the highway network

316
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:34,720
In a specific country.

317
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,576
So this is not limited to Los Angeles Road to New York

318
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:41,676
We can change it from Seattle to Florida,

319
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:44,200
On this day, at a certain time.

320
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,506
For example, you would go from Los Angeles to New York.

321
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,590
Now she goes from Los Angeles to Toronto.

322
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,870
If we leave the rules aside for some time,

323
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,696
From a technical point of view only,

324
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:59,546
The time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars,

325
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:03,386
He literally leaves the wheel and sleeps

326
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,370
Then he wakes up to find that he has arrived.

327
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,180
When will this be done safely?

328
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,706
I think it will happen in two years.

329
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:13,076
The real challenge is not in your ability to make it work

330
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:16,061
On 99,9 percent of the time.

331
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:20,159
Because if a car crashes a thousand times,

332
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,156
You will often remain restless.

333
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,170
And of course you don't have to.

334
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,360
(Laughter)

335
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,720
It will never be perfect.

336
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,510
There is no ideal system,

337
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,139
But if we say that maybe ...

338
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,786
Car collision is highly unlikely

339
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:46,220
In a hundred lives, or a thousand lives,

340
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,226
People would say, "Okay, great, if I could live a thousand lives,

341
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:52,796
I often won't have any accident,

342
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,326
This is often OK. "

343
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,436
you, sleep.

344
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,366
I guess what's most worrisome to you is that people are probably

345
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,636
Too early they think it's safe,

346
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,190
And that a horrific accident might delay things.

347
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,266
Well, I think the self-driving system is likely to mitigate the collision at least,

348
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,870
Except in rare circumstances.

349
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,546
The thing to be aware of about vehicle safety

350
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:19,820
Is that this is a possibility.

351
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,226
There is a possibility every time someone drives a car

352
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:27,186
That a collision occurs due to an error.

353
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,500
It is never zero.

354
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,656
The primary approach to self-reliance is

355
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:38,086
Knowing the extent to which self-driving must be superior to humans

356
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,470
Before you depend on it.

357
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,996
But once you have achieved safe driving literally without using hands,

358
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,796
The potential for confusion to the industry is enormous.

359
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:50,156
Because at that time, as I said, people will be able to buy a car,

360
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,426
It takes you to work, then lets it go

361
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:56,270
To work in services like Uber for other people,

362
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,360
Make money for you,

363
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,830
It may cover the purchase price of the car.

364
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,830
So you can almost like a car for free.

365
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,190
Is this really possible?

366
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,990
Yes, that will undoubtedly happen.

367
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,196
There will be a self-driving fleet to share

368
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,456
Where to buy your car

369
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:12,816
You can choose to use the car alone,

370
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,726
Or you choose to only be used by your friends and family,

371
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:21,590
Or only by other 5-star drivers,

372
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,500
You can share it sometimes and not at other times.

373
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,230
This is what will happen 100%.

374
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,641
It is only a matter of time.

375
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,690
just awesome.

376
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,170
So, you mentioned the midterm

377
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,490
And I think you plan to announce it in September,

378
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,146
But I wonder if there is anything you can offer us today?

379
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:46,996
I'm going to show you a truck teaser.

380
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,546
(Laughter)

381
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,496
She is alive.

382
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,580
OK.

383
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,790
This is definitely a case where caution is required

384
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,654
From disclosing the features of self-driving.

385
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,426
Yes.

386
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:00,730
(Laughter)

387
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,460
We can't see much.

388
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,780
But it does not look like a small friendly truck for residential neighborhoods.

389
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,276
Sounds somewhat hostile.

390
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:10,380
What kind of semi truck are you?

391
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,566
This is a high-performance, long-range semi truck.

392
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:19,836
So it has the highest load capacity

393
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,930
In addition to a long walk.

394
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,380
The main goal is to reduce heavy loads.

395
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,360
This is something that people currently believe is not possible.

396
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,140
They think that the truck does not have enough power or it does not have enough range,

397
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,700
And by Tesla midway truck,

398
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,436
We want to show them that this is wrong, as the electric truck

399
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:49,466
In fact, it can generate more torque than any semi-diesel truck.

400
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:53,626
If you do a tug-of-war,

401
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:58,846
Tesla's semitrailer pulls the diesel truck up a ramp.

402
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:00,996
(Laughter)

403
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,820
(clap)

404
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,126
This is so cool. In the short term, this is not self-driving.

405
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:09,650
Rather, they will be trucks that truck drivers drive.

406
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,956
Yes, what would be fun about her

407
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:18,260
The presence of a flat curve between the torque and the number of turns per minute, in the presence of an electric motor,

408
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,886
While in the presence of a diesel engine or any car powered by an internal combustion engine

409
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:24,890
You will get a hill curve.

410
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,610
So it will be a very graceful truck.

411
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,466
You can drive it like a sports car.

412
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,850
There is no transmission. As if it is a single speed.

413
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,170
A great movie about that will be made somewhere.

414
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,580
I don’t know what it is or will end well,

415
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,590
But it's a great movie.

416
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,560
(Laughter)

417
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,226
Her driving test was very strange.

418
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:48,210
When I was driving the prototype of the first truck.

419
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,546
That was really weird, because you drive

420
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:53,676
With great craftsmanship, you are in a huge truck.

421
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,130
Wait, did you drive a model earlier?

422
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,210
Yes, I drove it around the car park,

423
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,520
That was crazy.

424
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,940
Gorgeous. This is not fiction.

425
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,156
I was driving that huge truck,

426
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,040
And I'm doing crazy maneuvers.

427
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,666
that's cool. Well, let's go from a very aggressive picture

428
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,120
To a somewhat less hostile picture.

429
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,946
This is just a nice house from the series "Desperate Housewives" or something like that.

430
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:18,610
What is going on here?

431
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,660
Well, that shows a picture of the future

432
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,110
Which I think will evolve.

433
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,496
There is an electric car in the corridor.

434
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:30,266
If you look between the electric car and the house;

435
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,126
There are 3 wall batteries hanging on the side of the house,

436
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:36,926
Then there is the roof of the house, which is a solar roof

437
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:39,256
That is, it is a true solar panel roof.

438
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:40,310
OK.

439
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,626
This is a picture of a real home, in fact, it is a real fake house.

440
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,446
This is a real fake house.

441
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,406
(Laughter)

442
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,306
So these roof panels,

443
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:57,450
Some of them actually have solar energy, the ability to ...

444
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,276
Yes, solar panels

445
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:04,280
You can adjust its style and color

446
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,306
Up to a very subtle level,

447
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:11,896
There are also very small holes in the glass,

448
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,300
So that if you look at the ceiling from street level

449
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,106
Or near street level,

450
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,470
All panels look the same

451
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,580
Whether there is a solar cell under it or not.

452
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,220
So you see a regular color

453
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,750
When you look from the ground level.

454
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,460
If you look at it from a helicopter,

455
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,446
You can actually look through it and see

456
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:41,210
Some solar panels have a solar cell underneath, and some do not.

457
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,806
You wouldn't know this from street level.

458
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:45,280
You put it in the panels exposed to most sunlight,

459
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Which makes the plate prices reasonable, right?

460
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,790
It wouldn't be much more expensive than just a regular roof.

461
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,660
Yes.

462
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,260
We are sure to cost the roof

463
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,980
In addition to the cost of electricity ..

464
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,520
Solar panel roof will be less expensive than normal roof

465
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,156
Plus the cost of electricity.

466
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,396
In other words,

467
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,680
It would be easy economically,

468
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,616
We think it will look great,

469
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:15,630
It will last ..

470
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,670
We thought to make the guarantee endless,

471
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,890
But people thought

472
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,046
That might sound like we're talking nonsense.

473
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:28,210
But in fact, this is toughened glass.

474
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,136
After the house collapses,

475
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,046
And nothing remains,

476
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:36,626
The glass panels will remain intact.

477
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,146
(clap)

478
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,986
I mean, that's cool.

479
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:42,850
I'm going to release this in two weeks, I think,

480
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,416
Four different types of ceilings.

481
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,950
Yes, we will start by issuing two types, initially,

482
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,316
The other two will be issued early next year.

483
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:53,210
How big are your ambitions?

484
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,780
How many homes do you think may become covered with this type of roof?

485
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,820
I think at the end of the day,

486
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,020
Almost all homes will have sun roofs.

487
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,256
What needs to be taken into consideration is the timeframe

488
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:13,736
Which will often be around

489
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:16,946
40 or 50 years old.

490
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:21,820
On average, the roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years.

491
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,396
But you do not start to replace all ceilings immediately.

492
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:30,056
But in the end, if we can speed things up

493
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:33,416
Almost 15 years from now.

494
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,660
It would be uncommon to have a roof with no solar cells.

495
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,556
Is there something that people can't understand about this?

496
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:45,666
Because of the change in cost, and financial matters related to solar energy,

497
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:49,020
Most homes already have enough light for their roofs

498
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,276
To cover almost all of their energy needs.

499
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:53,086
If you can catch the energy,

500
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,206
It will cover almost all of their energy needs.

501
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,606
Electricity grid may be left.

502
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,270
It depends on where you are,

503
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,576
And the size of the house relative to the roof area,

504
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,456
But it is acceptable to say

505
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,270
Most homes in the U.S. have enough roof space

506
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,140
To provide all the energy needs of the home.

507
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,810
So, the decisive factor in an economy

508
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,846
Cars, semi trucks, and those homes

509
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:22,700
Is the low price of lithium-ion batteries,

510
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,260
This is what you bet on Tesla.

511
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,926
In many ways, this is often the center of your strength.

512
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:29,856
You have decided

513
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:35,076
That you are to maintain that strength;

514
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,530
You must build the largest factory in the world

515
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,796
To double the global production of lithium-ion batteries,

516
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:44,036
By this boy. What is that?

517
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,520
Yeah, this is Gigafactory,

518
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,256
What the plant "Gigafactory" reached.

519
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:52,166
In the end, you will be able to see

520
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,146
Something like a diamond

521
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:59,766
And when it's complete, it will look like a giant pile,

522
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,870
Or this is the idea behind it,

523
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,456
It is aligned with the true North.

524
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,286
This is one of the small details.

525
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,200
Will be able to produce, upon its completion,

526
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,360
About 100 GWh of batteries per year

527
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,966
100 GWh. And maybe more, but yeah.

528
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,740
And they are already produced now.

529
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,090
They are already produced. - You posted this video.

530
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,200
Was it accelerated?

531
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,146
This is the lazy version.

532
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:25,896
(Laughter)

533
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:28,256
How fast is he actually?

534
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:31,076
When it is running at top speed;

535
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,030
You cannot see cells without flashing.

536
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,360
Just something blurry.

537
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,816
(Laughter)

538
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:43,406
One of your basic ideas about what will make the future exciting

539
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,300
Is to have a future where we don't feel guilty about energy.

540
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,746
Help us visualize this.

541
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:53,766
How many "Gigafactory" factories are needed to get there?

542
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,526
About a hundred, approximately.

543
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:57,286
Not 10, not 1000.

544
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,910
So probably 100.

545
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,510
I see it's amazing

546
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,580
That you can imagine what it takes

547
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,916
To keep the world away from the massive use of fossil fuels.

548
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:11,360
You build one,

549
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,190
Its cost is 5 billion dollars

550
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,536
Next may cost 5 to 10 billion dollars.

551
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:20,076
It's great that you can imagine this project.

552
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,300
You are planning in Tesla to announce other manufacturers this year.

553
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,156
I think we will announce sites

554
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:32,026
Between two to four "Gigafactory" later this year.

555
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:33,380
Yes, often four.

556
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,496
Gorgeous.

557
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:38,116
(clap)

558
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,236
Are there no more teasers for us about that?

559
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:45,020
For example ... where? which continent?

560
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,250
You can answer no.

561
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,066
We must head to the global market.

562
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,316
OK.

563
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,650
(Laughter)

564
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,860
that's cool.

565
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,540
I think we should talk about ..

566
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,026
In fact, this is important.

567
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:10,130
And so I'm going to ask you one question in politics, just one.

568
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,906
I kind of got bored of politics, but I'd like to ask you this.

569
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:19,776
You have given advice to a person ...

570
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,000
who is he?

571
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,890
He said he does not believe in climate change,

572
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,290
There are many people who think that you should not have.

573
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,226
They would like to stay away from that.

574
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,510
What do you say to them?

575
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:36,140
Well, first,

576
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,720
I am a member of only two advisory councils,

577
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,576
Their goal is to walk around the room

578
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:44,486
And inquire about people's opinions on some things.

579
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:48,370
Therefore, a meeting is held approximately every one or two months.

580
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,536
This is my total contributions.

581
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:55,396
But I think that as there are people in the meetings

582
00:29:55,396 --> 00:30:00,166
They call to do something about climate change,

583
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:04,180
Or about social issues.

584
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,550
I took advantage of the meetings that I have attended so far

585
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:14,486
In the interest of defending migration and climate change.

586
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:16,390
(clap)

587
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,510
If I don't do that,

588
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,356
This was not on the agenda before.

589
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:25,870
Perhaps nothing will happen, but I have said at least what needs to be said.

590
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,746
OK.

591
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:30,620
(clap)

592
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,150
Let's talk about CibsX and Mars.

593
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,646
The last time you were here,

594
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:40,366
She talked about something that looked like an incredibly ambitious dream

595
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,686
It is the development of reusable missiles.

596
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,740
You went and did it.

597
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,466
Finally, it took a long time.

598
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:50,560
Tell us about this. What do we see here?

599
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,256
This is one of our missile boosters

600
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:57,866
It returns from a very high altitude and quickly into space.

601
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:01,206
He just pushed the upper stage of the missile

602
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,200
Very quickly.

603
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,236
I think his speed might have been about 7 times the speed of sound,

604
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:09,100
Pay the upper stage.

605
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
(clap)

606
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,170
It was accelerated ..

607
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,046
This was the slow version.

608
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,386
(Laughter)

609
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:20,860
I thought it was the quick version.

610
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,250
But this is awesome,

611
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,636
Many of these failed

612
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:26,586
Before you finally know how to do this,

613
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:29,350
But now you do this 5, 6 or 5 times?

614
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,810
I think we have come 8 or 9 times.

615
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,420
And for the first time,

616
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,696
You have already managed to fire one of the missiles that landed.

617
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:39,340
Yes, the missile booster landed,

618
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,046
Then we prepared it to fly again, then we fired it again,

619
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:47,100
So this is the first time that a space explorer has made a second trip

620
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,256
The two flights were connected.

621
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:52,596
It is very important to realize that the reuse is not connected

622
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:56,100
Unless it is fast and complete.

623
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,496
Like a plane or a car,

624
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:02,916
Reuse is quick and complete.

625
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:07,956
You do not send your plane to Boeing between flights.

626
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,810
Right. This allowed you to dream of a very ambitious idea

627
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,980
It is sending many, many people to Mars

628
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,446
In 10 to 20 years, I think.

629
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:19,846
Yes.

630
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:23,260
And you designed a massive rocket to do that.

631
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,746
Help us realize the size of this thing.

632
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:30,620
Well, visually, you can see a person.

633
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,366
Yes, and this is the vehicle.

634
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,980
(Laughter)

635
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,740
If that was a skyscraper,

636
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,286
It would almost be, right, a 40-storey skyscraper?

637
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:43,590
And maybe a little more, yes

638
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,180
In fact, his momentum is ..

639
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,100
This design has about 4 times the thrust of the "Saturn 5" missile.

640
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,146
Four times the thrust of the largest human-made missile.

641
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,340
Yes. Yes.

642
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,926
- As usual. - Yes.

643
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:08,916
(Laughter)

644
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,910
Compared to the 747, the 747 has a momentum of nearly a quarter of a million pounds.

645
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,050
That is, for every 10 million pounds of momentum

646
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,766
There are 40 aircraft 747.

647
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:26,046
That is, it will equal the thrust of 120 747s while all their engines are running.

648
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,220
Even with a machine designed to escape from gravity,

649
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,746
I thought you told me last time

650
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:35,096
This thing can carry a fully loaded 747,

651
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,366
People and merchandise, everything

652
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,666
Into orbit.

653
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:43,796
exactly. It can carry a 747 fully loaded aircraft with maximum fuel capacity,

654
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,336
The maximum number of passengers and the maximum cargo load for a 747 aircraft.

655
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:50,900
He can carry it as if it were goods.

656
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,650
So based on this,

657
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,480
You recently introduced the interplanetary system,

658
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,860
And that is how it was imagined.

659
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,010
When do you imagine this scene, after 30 years? 20 years?

660
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,306
For people to enter this missile.

661
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:13,886
I hope this will be in 8 to 10 years.

662
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,286
Hopefully, this is our goal.

663
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:19,486
Our own ambitions are exaggerated, but I think ..

664
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:21,499
(Laughter)

665
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,580
OK.

666
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,856
Although this vehicle looks very bulky

667
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,066
Huge compared to other missiles;

668
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:32,996
But I think the future spacecraft

669
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:36,860
This will make it look like a rowing boat.

670
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,836
Future spacecraft will be truly enormous.

671
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:45,049
Why, Elon?

672
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:49,200
Why do we need to build a city on Mars

673
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,290
With a million people in your life,

674
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,300
I think you said you would like to do this?

675
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,319
I think it is important that we have

676
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,706
An inspiring and attractive future.

677
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:06,516
I think there should be reasons

678
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:09,400
To wake up in the morning and want to live.

679
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,930
Meaning, why do you want to live?

680
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,726
What is the idea? What inspires you?

681
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,586
What do you like about the future?

682
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,120
And if we weren't there,

683
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,090
If the future does not include our interstellar existence

684
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,886
To become a multi-planet species,

685
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,396
I consider it very frustrating

686
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:27,846
That is not the future we get.

687
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:31,936
(clap)

688
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:34,250
People just want to make a choice,

689
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,106
Because there are so many miserable things happening on the planet right now

690
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:42,290
From climate to poverty, you know, choose from many,

691
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,750
This looks like distraction.

692
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,420
You shouldn't be thinking about this.

693
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,906
It should solve what is here and now.

694
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:52,056
And to be fair, you really did a good job of doing that

695
00:35:52,056 --> 00:35:54,716
Through your work in the field of renewable energy.

696
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,270
But why not just do that?

697
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,260
I think there is ..

698
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,116
I look to the future in terms of possibilities.

699
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:13,296
Sounds like a stream of possibilities.

700
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:18,300
There are actions we can take that affect these possibilities

701
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,100
Or hasten or delay something else.

702
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,150
Perhaps something new has been added to the stream of possibilities.

703
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,650
Sustainable energy will inevitably happen.

704
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,386
If there is no Tesla, if there is never Tesla,

705
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:38,246
It would have happened because of necessity.

706
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,760
It is repeated words.

707
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,576
If you do not have sustainable energy, this means that you have unsustainable energy.

708
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,156
In the end, she will run out of you,

709
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,990
Economic laws will lead civilization

710
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,706
Toward sustainable energy,

711
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:53,860
Necessarily.

712
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,900
The core value of a company like Tesla

713
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,396
Is how quickly it accelerates the emergence of sustainable energy,

714
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:04,052
Compared to what would have happened in another way.

715
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,150
So when I think,

716
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,956
What would be the primary benefit of a company like Tesla,

717
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:10,636
I will say, I hope,

718
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,250
If you accelerate this by a decade, perhaps more than a decade,

719
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,526
It would be a very good thing to happen.

720
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:20,076
This is what I consider

721
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,180
The primary benefit for Tesla.

722
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,666
As for us to become a multi-planet species and civilization traveling through space.

723
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,500
This is not a must.

724
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,070
It is very important to realize that this is not necessary.

725
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,536
I think the future of sustainable energy is largely inevitable,

726
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:44,216
But becoming a civilization traveling through space is certainly not inevitable.

727
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:48,390
If you look at the progress of space,

728
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,850
In 1969, we were able to send a person to the moon.

729
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,060
1969

730
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,490
Then we got our space shuttle.

731
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,970
The shuttle can only take people to a low orbit around Earth.

732
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,510
Then the space shuttle stopped,

733
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,110
The United States can no longer send anyone to orbit.

734
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,200
This is the trend.

735
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,100
The trend is like nothing goes down to nothing.

736
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,740
People make mistakes when they think

737
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,870
The technology is developing automatically.

738
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,800
It does not develop automatically.

739
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,486
It only develops if a lot of people work hard to make it better,

740
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:28,280
In fact, I think it will retreat on its own.

741
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,796
When you look at great civilizations like ancient Egypt,

742
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:32,706
They could build the pyramids,

743
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:34,480
Then they forgot how to do it.

744
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,396
And the Romans after that, they built amazing water canals.

745
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:39,360
Then they forgot how to do it.

746
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,540
Elon, it seems to me when I listen to you

747
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,856
And look at the different things you did

748
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,470
You have a unique double incentive about everything

749
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,220
I think it is interesting.

750
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,110
The first is the desire to act to advance humanity’s long-term interest.

751
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,506
The other is the desire to do something exciting.

752
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:03,196
It seems that you feel you need to push each other.

753
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,316
By Tesla, you want to achieve sustainable energy,

754
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:10,580
So you make these exciting and cool cars to do that.

755
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,200
Solar energy, to reach it,

756
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,817
So you make these beautiful ceilings.

757
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:16,390
We haven't even talked about your latest thing,

758
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,580
We don't have time for that.

759
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,816
But you want to protect humanity from evil artificial intelligence,

760
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,066
So you're going to create a great brain-automatic communication interface.

761
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:27,916
To provide us with infinite memory, the possibility of teleportation, etc.

762
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,766
On Mars, it appears that what you are trying to say is:

763
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:34,350
Yes, we want to save humanity

764
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,806
And to have an alternative plan,

765
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,056
But we also want to inspire humanity,

766
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,580
This is one way to inspire.

767
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,236
I think my values ​​of beauty and inspiration

768
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,366
They are not valued enough,

769
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:52,820
No doubt.

770
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,196
But I want to be clear.

771
00:39:54,196 --> 00:39:56,316
I am not trying to be the savior of anyone.

772
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:57,340
This is not what ..

773
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,830
I am just trying to think of the future

774
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,060
Without being sad.

775
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,310
(clap)

776
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,540
a beautiful saying.

777
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,726
I think all of here is agreed

778
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:12,820
As no ...

779
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,716
None of this will inevitably happen.

780
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:19,350
And the fact that you dream about these things in your mind,

781
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,986
You dream of things that no one else would dare dream about,

782
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,656
Or no other person is able to dream

783
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,346
With the same level of complexity you dream about.

784
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:31,276
The fact that you do that, Elon, is great.

785
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:34,226
Thanks for helping us all to dream bigger dreams.

786
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:38,456
But you'll alert me if it starts to get real crazy, right?

787
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:40,296
(Laughter)

788
00:40:40,296 --> 00:40:43,426
Thanks, Elon Musk, that was pretty cool.

789
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:45,136
That was really cool.

790
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:48,940
(clap)
