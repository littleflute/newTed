00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:17,542
In 1987, a Chilean engineer
named Oscar Duhalde

3
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:20,869
became the only
living person on the planet

4
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:23,612
to discover a rare astronomical event

5
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:24,972
with the naked eye.

6
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:30,362
Oscar was a telescope operator
at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.

7
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:34,444
He worked with the astronomers who came
to the observatory for their research,

8
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:38,059
running the telescopes and processing
the data that they took.

9
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:40,753
On the night of February 24th,

10
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:42,793
Oscar stepped outside for a break

11
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:45,720
and looked up at the night sky
and he saw this.

12
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,468
This is the Large Magellanic Cloud.

13
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:52,199
It's a satellite galaxy very near
our own Milky Way.

14
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:53,565
But on that February night,

15
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,521
Oscar noticed that something
was different about this galaxy.

16
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:58,109
It didn't quite look like this.

17
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,365
It looked like this.

18
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:02,641
Did you see it?

19
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:03,698
(Laughter)

20
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:08,863
A small point of light had appeared
in one corner of this galaxy.

21
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:12,091
So to explain how amazing it is
that Oscar noticed this,

22
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,757
we need to zoom out a bit

23
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:17,388
and look at what the southern
sky in Chile looks like.

24
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:21,019
The Large Magellanic Cloud
is right in the middle of that image,

25
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:24,049
but despite its name, it's really small.

26
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:27,946
Imagine trying to notice
one single new point of light

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,732
appearing in that galaxy.

28
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,210
Oscar was able to do this

29
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:36,311
because he had the Large Magellanic Cloud
essentially memorized.

30
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:39,547
He had worked on data
from this galaxy for years,

31
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,169
poring over night after night
of observations

32
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:44,093
and doing it by hand,

33
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:47,011
because Oscar had begun
his work in astronomy

34
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:51,323
at a time when we stored all of the data
that we observed from the universe

35
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,736
on fragile sheets of glass.

36
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:56,635
I know that today's theme is "Moonshot,"

37
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,360
and as an astronomer, I figured
I could start us out nice and literally,

38
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,320
so here's a shot of the Moon.

39
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:03,349
(Laughter)

40
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,886
It's a familiar sight to all of us,
but there's a couple of unusual things

41
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,462
about this particular image.

42
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,472
For one, I flipped the colors.

43
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,499
It originally looked like this.

44
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:16,013
And if we zoom out, we can see
how this picture was taken.

45
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:20,037
This is a photograph
of the Moon taken in 1894

46
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,774
on a glass photographic plate.

47
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:26,655
This was the technology that astronomers
had available for decades

48
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,283
to store the observations
that we took of the night sky.

49
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:34,723
I've actually brought an example
of a glass plate to show you.

50
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:37,799
So this looks like a real secure way
to store our data.

51
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:41,867
These photographic plates
were incredibly difficult to work with.

52
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:46,442
One side of them was treated
with a chemical emulsion that would darken

53
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,299
when it was exposed to light.

54
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:51,952
This is how these plates were able
to store the pictures that they took,

55
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:56,505
but it meant that astronomers
had to work with these plates in darkness.

56
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:59,239
The plates had to be cut
to a specific size

57
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,968
so that they could fit
into the camera of a telescope.

58
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:04,783
So astronomers would take
razor-sharp cutting tools

59
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:08,446
and slice these tiny pieces of glass,

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,083
all in the dark.

61
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,944
Astronomers also had all kinds of tricks
that they would use

62
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:15,626
to make the plates
respond to light a little faster.

63
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,967
They would bake them or freeze them,
they would soak them in ammonia,

64
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,895
or they'd coat them with lemon juice --

65
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,331
all in the dark.

66
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:25,137
Then astronomers would take
these carefully designed plates

67
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,322
to the telescope

68
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,289
and load them into the camera.

69
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:32,044
They had to be loaded with that
chemically emulsified side pointed out

70
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,577
so that the light would hit it.

71
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:38,128
But in the dark, it was almost impossible
to tell which side was the right one.

72
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,642
Astronomers got into the habit
of tapping a plate to their lips,

73
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:45,927
or, like, licking it, to see
which side of the plate was sticky

74
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:48,098
and therefore coated with the emulsion.

75
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:50,661
And then when they actually
put it into the camera,

76
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,794
there was one last challenge.

77
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,301
In this picture behind me,

78
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,823
you can see that the plate
the astronomer is holding

79
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:58,456
is very slightly curved.

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,940
Sometimes plates had to be bent
to fit into a telescope's camera,

81
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:07,976
so you would take this carefully cut,
meticulously treated, very babied plate

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,533
up to a telescope, and then you'd just ...

83
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,417
So sometimes that would work.
Sometimes they would snap.

84
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,821
But it would usually end
with the [plate] loaded into a camera

85
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:19,392
on the back of a telescope.

86
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,132
You could then point that telescope

87
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,372
to whatever patch of sky
you wanted to study,

88
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,658
open the camera shutter,

89
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,585
and begin capturing data.

90
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:29,973
Now, astronomers couldn't just
walk away from the camera

91
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:31,155
once they'd done this.

92
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,542
They had to stay with that camera
for as long as they were observing.

93
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,758
This meant that astronomers
would get into elevators

94
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,802
attached to the side
of the telescope domes.

95
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,399
They would ride the elevator
high into the building

96
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,848
and then climb into
the top of the telescope

97
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:49,578
and stay there all night
shivering in the cold,

98
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:51,731
transferring plates
in and out of the camera,

99
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,407
opening and closing the shutter

100
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:55,885
and pointing the telescope
to whatever piece of sky

101
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,526
they wanted to study.

102
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,835
These astronomers worked with operators
who would stay on the ground.

103
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:03,374
And they would do things
like turn the dome itself

104
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:06,057
and make sure the rest
of the telescope was running.

105
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,352
It was a system that usually
worked pretty well,

106
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,689
but once in a while,
things would go wrong.

107
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:14,276
There was an astronomer observing
a very complicated plate

108
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,590
at this observatory,
the Lick Observatory here in California.

109
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,453
He was sitting at the top
of that yellow structure

110
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:22,937
that you see in the dome
on the lower right,

111
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:27,390
and he'd been exposing
one glass plate to the sky for hours,

112
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,233
crouched down and cold

113
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,626
and keeping the telescope
perfectly pointed

114
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,531
so he could take this precious
picture of the universe.

115
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,231
His operator wandered
into the dome at one point

116
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,729
just to check on him
and see how things were going.

117
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,991
And as the operator stepped through
the door of the dome,

118
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:49,383
he brushed against the wall
and flipped the light switch in the dome.

119
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:52,413
So the lights came blazing on
and flooding into the telescope

120
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,849
and ruining the plate,

121
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:57,055
and there was then this howl
from the top of the telescope.

122
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,767
The astronomer started yelling
and cursing and saying,

123
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,489
"What have you done?
You've destroyed so much hard work.

124
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:05,174
I'm going to get down
from this telescope and kill you!"

125
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,693
So he then starts moving the telescope

126
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:08,868
about this fast --

127
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:09,898
(Laughter)

128
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,185
toward the elevator

129
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,870
so that he can climb down
and make good on his threats.

130
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:15,751
Now, as he's approaching the elevator,

131
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,449
the elevator then suddenly
starts spinning away from him,

132
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:21,251
because remember, the astronomer
can control the telescope,

133
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,100
but the operator can control the dome.

134
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,131
(Laughter)

135
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:26,022
And the operator is looking up, going,

136
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:30,258
"He seems really mad. I might not want
to let him down until he's less murdery."

137
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:33,217
So the end is this absurd
slow-motion game of chase

138
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:36,308
with the lights on and the dome
just spinning around and around.

139
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,500
It must have looked completely ridiculous.

140
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:42,433
When I tell people about using
photographic plates to study the universe,

141
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:44,106
it does sound ridiculous.

142
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,437
It's a little absurd

143
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,847
to take what seems like a primitive tool
for studying the universe

144
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:51,901
and say, well, we're going
to dunk this in lemon juice, lick it,

145
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,836
stick it in the telescope,
shiver next to it for a few hours

146
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,301
and solve the mysteries of the cosmos.

147
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,666
In reality, though,
that's exactly what we did.

148
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,948
I showed you this picture before

149
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,680
of an astronomer perched
at the top of a telescope.

150
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:07,858
What I didn't tell you
is who this astronomer is.

151
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,337
This is Edwin Hubble,

152
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,626
and Hubble used photographic plates

153
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,516
to completely change
our entire understanding

154
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,263
of how big the universe is
and how it works.

155
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,535
This is a plate
that Hubble took back in 1923

156
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,909
of an object known at the time
as the Andromeda Nebula.

157
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,376
You can see in the upper
right of that image

158
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,892
that Hubble has labeled a star
with this bright red word, "Var!"

159
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,545
He's even put an exclamation
point next to it.

160
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,877
"Var" here stands for "variable."

161
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:40,077
Hubble had found a variable star
in the Andromeda Nebula.

162
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,684
Its brightness changed,

163
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,275
getting brighter and dimmer
as a function of time.

164
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:48,262
Hubble knew that if he studied
how that star changed with time,

165
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:51,398
he could measure the distance
to the Andromeda Nebula,

166
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:54,591
and when he did,
the results were astonishing.

167
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:57,622
He discovered that this was not,
in fact, a nebula.

168
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,688
This was the Andromeda Galaxy,

169
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,894
an entire separate galaxy
two and a half million light years

170
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:04,799
beyond our own Milky Way.

171
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:07,196
This was the first evidence
of other galaxies

172
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,391
existing in the universe beyond our own,

173
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:13,769
and it totally changed our understanding
of how big the universe was

174
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,166
and what it contained.

175
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,938
So now we can look at
what telescopes can do today.

176
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:21,870
This is a modern-day picture
of the Andromeda Galaxy,

177
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:23,933
and it looks just like
the telescope photos

178
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:25,814
that we all love to enjoy and look at:

179
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,581
it's colorful and detailed and beautiful.

180
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:31,221
We now store data like this digitally,

181
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,566
and we take it using
telescopes like these.

182
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,542
So this is me standing underneath
a telescope with a mirror

183
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:40,049
that's 26 feet across.

184
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:44,217
Bigger telescope mirrors let us take
sharper and clearer images,

185
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,740
and they also make it
easier for us to gather light

186
00:08:46,764 --> 00:08:49,727
from faint and faraway objects.

187
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:53,190
So a bigger telescope literally
gives us a farther reach

188
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:54,388
into the universe,

189
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:57,224
looking at things that we
couldn't have seen before.

190
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,009
We're also no longer strapped
to the telescope

191
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,781
when we do our observations.

192
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:04,295
This is me during
my very first observing trip

193
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,977
at a telescope in Arizona.

194
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:08,198
I'm opening the dome of the telescope,

195
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,634
but I'm not on top
of the telescope to do it.

196
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:13,342
I'm sitting in a room
off to the side of the dome,

197
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,660
nice and warm and on the ground

198
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:17,652
and running the telescope from afar.

199
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:19,668
"Afar" can get pretty extreme.

200
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,730
Sometimes we don't even need
to go to telescopes anymore.

201
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:26,875
This is a telescope in New Mexico
that I use for my research all the time,

202
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,879
but I can run it with my laptop.

203
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,046
I can sit on my couch in Seattle

204
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,034
and send commands from my laptop

205
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:35,184
telling the telescope where to point,

206
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,254
when to open and close the shutter,

207
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,867
what pictures I want it
to take of the universe --

208
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:42,279
all from many states away.

209
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:45,708
So the way that we operate
telescopes has really changed,

210
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:48,531
but the questions we're trying to answer
about the universe

211
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,988
have remained the same.

212
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:55,643
One of the big questions still focuses
on how things change in the night sky,

213
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,222
and the changing sky was exactly
what Oscar Duhalde saw

214
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:02,700
when he looked up
with the naked eye in 1987.

215
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:07,858
This point of light that he saw appearing
in the Large Magellanic Cloud

216
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:09,866
turned out to be a supernova.

217
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,182
This was the first naked-eye supernova

218
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:16,821
seen from Earth in more than 400 years.

219
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,606
This is pretty cool,

220
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,530
but a couple of you might
be looking at this image and going,

221
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,227
"Really? I've heard of supernovae.

222
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,964
They're supposed to be spectacular,

223
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:27,641
and this is just like a dot
that appeared in the sky."

224
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:30,877
It's true that when you hear
the description of what a supernova is

225
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,098
it sounds really epic.

226
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:36,527
They're these brilliant, explosive deaths
of enormous, massive stars,

227
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,645
and they shoot energy
out into the universe,

228
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,576
and they spew material out into space,

229
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,953
and they sound, like, noticeable.

230
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,438
They sound really obvious.

231
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,177
The whole trick about
what a supernova looks like

232
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,401
has to do with where it is.

233
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,512
If a star were to die as a supernova

234
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:55,361
right in our backyard in the Milky Way,
a few hundred light years away --

235
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,387
"backyard" in astronomy terms --

236
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:59,421
it would be incredibly bright.

237
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:02,233
We would be able to see
that supernova at night

238
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:03,745
as bright as the Moon.

239
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,976
We would be able to read by its light.

240
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:09,840
Everybody would wind up taking photos
of this supernova on their phone.

241
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,032
It would be on headlines
all over the world.

242
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:13,967
It would for sure get a hashtag.

243
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:18,682
It would be impossible to miss
that a supernova had happened so nearby.

244
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:21,293
But the supernova that Oscar observed

245
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:24,023
didn't happen a few hundred
light years away.

246
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:29,577
This supernova happened
170,000 light years away,

247
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:32,349
which is why instead of an epic explosion,

248
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:33,999
it appears as a little dot.

249
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,711
This was still unbelievably exciting.

250
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:38,999
It was still visible with the naked eye,

251
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:40,893
and the most spectacular supernova

252
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,606
that we've seen since
the invention of the telescope.

253
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,242
But it gives you a better sense
of what most supernovae look like.

254
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,048
We still discover and study
supernovae all the time today,

255
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:54,912
but we do it in distant galaxies
using powerful telescopes.

256
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:57,415
We photograph the galaxy multiple times,

257
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,464
and we look for something that's changed.

258
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,999
We look for that little
pinprick of light appearing

259
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:04,188
that tells us that a star has died.

260
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:07,620
We can learn a great deal
about the universe and about stars

261
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,881
from supernovae,

262
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,772
but we don't want to leave
studying them up to chance.

263
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:15,467
We don't want to count on
happening to look up at the right time

264
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,956
or pointing our telescope
at the right galaxy.

265
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:20,797
What we ideally want is a telescope

266
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:24,271
that can systematically
and computationally

267
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:27,007
do what Oscar did with his mind.

268
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:30,294
Oscar was able to discover this supernova

269
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:33,293
because he had that galaxy memorized.

270
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:35,079
With digital data,

271
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:39,069
we can effectively memorize
every piece of the sky that we look at,

272
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,336
compare old and new observations

273
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,980
and look for anything that's changed.

274
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,745
This is the Vera Rubin Observatory

275
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,023
in Chile.

276
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:53,004
Now, when I visited it back in March,
it was still under construction.

277
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:56,198
But this telescope
will begin observations next year,

278
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:57,412
and when it does,

279
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:02,174
it will carry out a simple
but spectacular observing program.

280
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:06,500
This telescope will photograph
the entire southern sky

281
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,064
every few days

282
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,270
over and over,

283
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:11,111
following a preset pattern

284
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,017
for 10 years.

285
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:16,905
Computers and algorithms
affiliated with the observatory

286
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,594
will then compare every pair of images
taken of the same patch of sky,

287
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:24,239
looking for anything
that's gotten brighter or dimmer,

288
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,723
like a variable star,

289
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,788
or looking for anything that's appeared,

290
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:29,402
like a supernova.

291
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:33,764
Right now, we discover about
a thousand supernovae every year.

292
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:38,138
The Rubin Observatory will be capable
of discovering a thousand supernovae

293
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:39,680
every night.

294
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:43,084
It's going to dramatically change
the face of astronomy

295
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:46,100
and of how we study things
that change in the sky,

296
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:47,854
and it will do all of this

297
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:50,120
largely without much
human intervention at all.

298
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:52,111
It will follow that preset pattern

299
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:55,632
and computationally find
anything that's changed or appeared.

300
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:58,516
This might sound a little sad at first,

301
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,480
this idea that we're removing
people from stargazing.

302
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:03,124
But in reality,

303
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,492
our role as astronomers
isn't disappearing,

304
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:06,956
it's just moving.

305
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,674
We've already seen
how we do our jobs change.

306
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:12,025
We've gone from perching atop telescopes

307
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:13,468
to sitting next to them

308
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:16,882
to not even needing to go to them
or send them commands at all.

309
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,376
Where astronomers still shine

310
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,343
is in asking questions
and working with the data.

311
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:25,178
Gathering data is only the first step.

312
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:29,979
Analyzing it is where we can really apply
what we know about the universe.

313
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,297
Human curiosity is what makes us
ask questions like:

314
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,422
How big is the universe?
How did it begin?

315
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:38,277
How's it going to end? And are we alone?

316
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:42,710
So this is the power that humans
are still able to bring to astronomy.

317
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:46,131
So compare the capabilities
of a telescope like this

318
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:49,715
with the observations
that we were able to take like this.

319
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,907
We discovered amazing things
with glass plates,

320
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:55,040
but discovery looks different today.

321
00:14:55,064 --> 00:14:57,777
The way we do astronomy
looks different today.

322
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,244
What hasn't changed
is that seed of human curiosity.

323
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:05,175
If we can harness the power
of tomorrow's technology

324
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,715
and combine it with this drive
that we all have to look up

325
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:11,334
and to ask questions
about what we see there,

326
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:14,117
we'll be ready to learn
some incredible new things

327
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:15,517
about the universe.

328
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,749
Thank you.

329
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:18,946
(Applause)
