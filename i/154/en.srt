2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,095
I am completely comfortable in this place.

3
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,002
Do not misunderstand me,

4
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:20,010
My heart was beating so hard that I was surprised not to hear its beating.

5
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:22,483
I feel lightness in my head

6
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:24,521
My hands are a little sweaty.

7
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:29,670
Fortunately, I am not just used to this

8
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:30,844
I even enjoy it.

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,347
(Music)

10
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,284
During my career as an air player

11
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:42,263
I learned to listen to these signs my body makes,

12
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:45,054
Its main purpose is to keep me alive.

13
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,703
This inner feeling of fear can be the source of the pleasure.

14
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:52,179
Why do you think we ride a roller coaster?

15
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:53,543
Or do we watch horror movies?

16
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,781
Or fly in the air like I do?

17
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,965
But these moments are not enjoyable unless you choose.

18
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:04,620
Those who enjoy watching horror movies know that they can look away.

19
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:05,980
And when I fly in the air

20
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:09,370
To hold my colleague's hand while we are high in the circus tent,

21
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:13,756
I can choose to drop my hands and fly to him if I trust he will catch me.

22
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:18,574
Listening to these signs is a very important life skill

23
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:21,407
For everyone, not just my thrillers.

24
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:27,362
If we don't know how to listen and respond to signs of fear

25
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,349
We are in danger of submission

26
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:32,386
To respond by confrontation, flight, or inertia.

27
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:35,106
When I teach circus skills

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,647
I notice that my students feel these feelings every day.

29
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,968
And when they feel it

30
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:43,147
Because there is a special opportunity to talk to them about it,

31
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,564
To recognize and trust these feelings

32
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:49,084
They also learn how to say no when they are not comfortable with something.

33
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,616
This is a great base

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,546
To connect with our bodies in various situations

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,855
It is neither intimidating nor strange.

36
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:59,293
It is natural and thoughtful.

37
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:04,518
Because I'm actually not just teaching circus skills

38
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,475
I'm even teaching consent how to get too.

39
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,819
In addition to teaching me circus skills

40
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:12,558
I am fortunate to work with hundreds of young men and women every year

41
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:15,785
As a teacher of the fundamentals of preventing sexual violence.

42
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,280
I hear their stories straight from them

43
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:21,770
I know from statistics and from my experience

44
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:25,270
Most of the survivors know who violated them

45
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:29,572
There are high rates of adolescents who have been subjected to sexual violence by their partner,

46
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,626
Anyone they are dating.

47
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:36,368
Young people want to know how to talk to their partner about intimacy.

48
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,217
The more you help teens understand sexual consent

49
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:45,614
I realized that learning to play in the air can help us with our lives on Earth.

50
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:50,577
So let me explain to you what I mean by teaching consent through the circus.

51
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,325
Imagine that you are sitting for the first time on an acrobatic swing.

52
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:57,972
The traditional instructions for you will be as follows:

53
00:02:57,996 --> 00:03:00,283
Well, you have to cross your feet over the bar.

54
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:01,862
And climb on the rope using your hands

55
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,061
Then pull yourself up until you sit down

56
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:04,511
And never let go. "

57
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:09,775
This method pushes the learner forward without discussing it with him

58
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,438
Also, this method focuses on what the teacher wants from the student.

59
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:15,858
This way I tell them how and when to move their bodies,

60
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:18,102
Ignoring their comfort or fear.

61
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:23,329
This instills fear in the hearts of beginners and prompts them not to return again.

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,891
While the way I talk to my students

63
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,386
It gives them a lot of attention

64
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,769
I make sure that they know exactly what will happen

65
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:32,944
And they are ready

66
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,184
They are part of the conversation that we have.

67
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,874
Addy Delaney: How are you feeling now? Student: Really fine.

68
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:40,857
ADI DELANI: I feel like you can do it. Do you want to give it a try?

69
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,632
Student: Okay. Adi Delaney: Yeah, like that.

70
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,725
Adi Delaney: Yeah, but with the soles of your feet.

71
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:46,871
Just like that, yeah.

72
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,664
this is beautiful. How do you feel now?

73
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,847
Student: Wonderful. Adi Delaney: Really cool, okay.

74
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:53,620
Well done, I'll put my hand on your back ...

75
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:54,795
Here you are.

76
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,957
I'll support you by your foot, and then I'll put my hand here.

77
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:59,394
Do you feel that you can put your hand on the penis?

78
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:00,822
I'll keep catching you.

79
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,989
how do you feel? Are you comfortable?

80
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:03,896
Student: Yes?

81
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:06,899
ADDE DELANI: I can protect you if you lean forward or backward, see?

82
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,232
Here I caught you!

83
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,937
(Audio commentary) ADD Delaney: That kind of talk

84
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,253
Like, "How do you feel?"

85
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:14,335
May I put my hand here? "

86
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,320
Contributes to the success of circus acrobats.

87
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,454
And I think it reduces the risk of accidents,

88
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,596
This is the result of the confidence my students feel

89
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,840
And their ability to act on their opinion and feelings

90
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,490
At any time.

91
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,965
This characteristic is necessary in life in general

92
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:33,444
When seeking intimacy with someone,

93
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,519
But because it is not a normal part of our behavior

94
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,940
It may sound very strange

95
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:41,870
Some may think that it is easier to reduce speech.

96
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,767
But the lessening of speech creates mystery

97
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,219
It creates problems and may cause violence and abuse.

98
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,082
There is, of course, no set standard method for requesting approval.

99
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:56,273
The words and dialect you use are your own.

100
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,597
It is a simple modification of our speaking method to add a request for approval

101
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:06,118
Every time we have a relationship with someone's body, whether it's intimate or not.

102
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,293
For example

103
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:10,444
Use "I" when talking about how you feel.

104
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,967
And use questions more than declarative sentences when you are talking to someone else.

105
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:15,919
And when you are in an intimate relationship

106
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,534
Check out the other one, such as asking, â€œDoes this enjoy you?

107
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:20,010
Do you like that? "

108
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:24,327
In addition to telling your partner what you need, want, or love,

109
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,617
This helps us make these moments unforgettable

110
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,221
And do not regret it later.

111
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:33,117
We must broaden our understanding of consent

112
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:34,945
And to start looking at it as verb

113
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,119
It is not a name.

114
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:40,103
Consent is an ongoing and effective agreement

115
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,195
And it is not just a square that should be pointed out.

116
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,751
When we talk to young men and women

117
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,581
We will have a chance to educate them

118
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:49,918
How to communicate with concern for the other person

119
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:54,276
And check the other and respect him and his feelings and his will.

120
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,383
If we make consent a normal thing in everything

121
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:01,687
It's by the time someone is ready for sex

122
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:04,701
He will know that he has the right to ask questions

123
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,570
And stop whenever he wants

124
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:08,213
And most important of all

125
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,788
To enjoy these moments.

126
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:12,212
Children are our future,

127
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:15,457
And they will learn how to show concern just as we do.

128
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:19,585
Seeking consent during sex doesn't necessarily have to be a killer of pleasure

129
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:21,677
Nor does the definition of sexuality.

130
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:26,050
Rather, it can be - as in a circus - fun, joyful and joyful.

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,567
Our intimate relationship doesn't just have to be safe

132
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,089
It should be as exciting as flying in the air.

133
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,166
thank you.
