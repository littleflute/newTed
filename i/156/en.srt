00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:16,722
My first year in graduate school,
studying cooperation in monkeys,

3
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,969
I spent a lot of time outside,

4
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:21,886
just watching our groups
of capuchin monkeys interact.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,827
One afternoon, I was out back
feeding peanuts to one of our groups,

6
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,573
which required distracting
one of our males, Ozzie,

7
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:31,169
enough so that the other monkeys
could get some.

8
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:33,328
Ozzie loved peanuts,

9
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:36,576
and he always tried to do
anything he could to grab some.

10
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,575
On that day, however,

11
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:41,996
he began trying to bring other things
from his enclosure to me

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,673
and trade them with me
in order to get a peanut.

13
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:49,077
Now, capuchins are smart,
so this wasn't necessarily a surprise.

14
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:50,879
But what was a surprise

15
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,332
was that some of the things
that he was bringing me,

16
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:56,371
I was pretty sure he liked
better than peanuts.

17
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,961
First, he brought me
a piece of monkey chow,

18
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:00,588
which is like dried dog food --

19
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:02,572
it was even made by Purina --

20
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,791
and for a monkey,
is about as worthless as it gets.

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,260
Of course, I didn't give him
a peanut for that.

22
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,228
But he kept trying,

23
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:13,581
and eventually, he brought me
a quarter of an orange

24
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,533
and tried to trade it
with me for a peanut.

25
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,034
Now, oranges are a valuable
monkey commodity,

26
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:23,264
so this trade seemed, shall I say,
a little bit nuts?

27
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:26,828
Now you may be wondering
how we know what monkeys prefer.

28
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:28,177
Well, we ask them,

29
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,439
by giving them a choice between two foods

30
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:32,136
and seeing which one they pick.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,188
Generally speaking,
their preferences are a lot like ours:

32
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,569
the sweeter it is, the more they like it.

33
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,347
So, much like humans prefer
cupcakes to kale,

34
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:43,561
monkeys prefer fruits,
like oranges or grapes,

35
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:45,236
to vegetables like cucumbers,

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,458
and all of this to monkey chow.

37
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,514
And peanuts are not bad.

38
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:53,219
However, they definitely don't prefer them
to a chunk of orange.

39
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:56,701
So when Ozzie tried to trade
a quarter of an orange for a peanut,

40
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,058
it was a surprise,

41
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:02,066
and I began to wonder
if he suddenly wanted that peanut

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,939
because everybody else
in his group was getting one.

43
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,292
In case you're wondering,
I did give Ozzie his peanut.

44
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:10,983
But then I went straight
to my graduate adviser,

45
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,165
Frans de Waal,

46
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,149
and we began to design a study

47
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:16,292
to see how the monkeys would respond

48
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:20,133
when somebody else in their group
got a better reward than they did

49
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,132
for doing the same work.

50
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,474
It was a very simple study.

51
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,462
We took two monkeys from the same group

52
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:28,331
and had them sit side by side,

53
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,855
and they would do a task,

54
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,950
which was trading a token with me,

55
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:34,506
and if they did so successfully,

56
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,045
they got a reward.

57
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,736
The catch was that one monkey
always got a piece of cucumber,

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,625
and the other monkey
sometimes got a piece of cucumber,

59
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,513
but sometimes got a grape.

60
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:45,696
And if you'll recall,

61
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,188
grapes are much preferred to cucumbers

62
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,426
on the capuchin monkey hierarchy.

63
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,267
These are two of my capuchin monkeys.

64
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,934
Winter, on the right,
is trading for a grape,

65
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,021
and Lance, on the left,
is trading for a cucumber.

66
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,426
You can see that she --
and yes, Lance is actually a female --

67
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,270
is at first perfectly happy
with her cucumber,

68
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:07,532
until she sees Winter trading for a grape.

69
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:11,018
Suddenly, Lance is very
enthusiastic about trading.

70
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,459
She gets her cucumber,
takes a bite and then --

71
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,285
throws it right back out again.

72
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,650
Meanwhile, Winter trades again
and gets another grape

73
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:25,158
and has Lance's undivided attention
while she eats it.

74
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:26,728
This time,

75
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:29,714
Lance is not
so enthusiastic about trading.

76
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,363
But eventually, she does so.

77
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:35,323
But when she gets the cucumber
this time around,

78
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:38,037
she doesn't even take a bite

79
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,461
before she throws it back out again.

80
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,895
Apparently, Lance only wants a cucumber

81
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,692
when she hasn't just watched
Winter eat a grape.

82
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:49,117
And Lance was not alone in this.

83
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,601
All of my capuchins were perfectly happy
with their cucumbers

84
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,442
as long as the other monkeys
were getting cucumbers too.

85
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,974
But they often weren't so happy
with their cucumbers

86
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:00,561
when other monkeys were getting a grape.

87
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:03,401
The obvious question is why?

88
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:06,053
If they liked those cucumbers before,

89
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,244
what changed?

90
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:09,101
Now, I'm a scientist,

91
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,887
and scientists are famously shy
about reading too much into our studies,

92
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,180
especially when it comes
to what other animals

93
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,395
are thinking or feeling,

94
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:17,835
because we can't ask them.

95
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,741
But still, what I was seeing in my monkeys

96
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:24,408
looked an awful lot like what we humans
would call a sense of fairness.

97
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,621
After all,

98
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:30,125
the difference in that cucumber
was that it came after Winter got a grape,

99
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:31,669
rather than before.

100
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:35,241
We humans are obsessed with fairness.

101
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,855
I have a younger sister,

102
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,070
and when we were little,

103
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:40,839
if my sister got a bigger piece
of the pie than me,

104
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,506
even by a crumb,

105
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,236
I was furious.

106
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,363
It wasn't fair.

107
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:49,402
And the childhood me is not alone.

108
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:54,132
We humans hate getting
less than another so much

109
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:55,950
that one study found

110
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,703
that if humans were given
a hypothetical choice

111
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,894
between earning 50,000 dollars a year

112
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,155
while others earned 25,000 dollars,

113
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,441
or earning 100,000 dollars a year

114
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:08,227
while others earned 250,000 dollars,

115
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,323
nearly half the subjects

116
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:14,077
prefer to earn 50,000 dollars
a year less money

117
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:17,644
to avoid earning relatively less
than someone else.

118
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,868
That's a pretty big price to pay.

119
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:21,676
What drives people

120
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,866
to this sort of apparently
irrational decision-making?

121
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,057
After all,

122
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:29,176
throwing away your cucumber
because someone else got a grape

123
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,279
only makes sense
if it makes things more fair.

124
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:36,708
Otherwise, Winter has a grape,
and you have nothing.

125
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,354
Of course humans are not capuchin monkeys.

126
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:40,671
But on the surface,

127
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,553
sacrificing 50,000 dollars

128
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:45,315
because somebody else
is going to earn more money than you

129
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,632
makes no more sense
than throwing away that cucumber.

130
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:50,836
Except maybe it does.

131
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:52,804
Some economists think

132
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:56,153
that the sense of fairness in humans
is tied to cooperation.

133
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,304
In other words, we need
that sense of fairness

134
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,109
when we're working with somebody else

135
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,696
to know when we're getting
the short end of the stick.

136
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,879
Think about it this way.

137
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:07,871
Let's say you have a colleague at work
who's having a hard time

138
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:09,347
and needs a little extra help.

139
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,442
You're probably more
than happy to help out,

140
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,685
especially if she does
the same for you when you need it.

141
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,010
In other words, if things even out.

142
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,185
But now,

143
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,756
let's say that colleague
is always slacking off

144
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,363
and dumping extra work on you.

145
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,664
That's infuriating.

146
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:25,839
Or worse,

147
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:29,434
what if you're doing all the work,
and she's getting paid more.

148
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,537
You're outraged, right?

149
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:34,569
As well you should be.

150
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,682
That righteous fury
is your sense of fairness

151
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:41,149
telling you that, well, it's not fair.

152
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:44,701
You need to get your fair share
from the people you're working with,

153
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,494
or it's exploitation, not cooperation.

154
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:51,550
You may not be able to leave every job
where you're treated unfairly,

155
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:52,780
but in a perfect world,

156
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:54,744
one without racism and sexism

157
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:57,768
and the frictions associated
with finding a new job,

158
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,187
it's your sense of fairness
that would let you know

159
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,117
when it was time to move on.

160
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:03,514
And if you couldn't?

161
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:08,855
Well, that smoldering frustration
might make you throw your cucumbers too.

162
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,339
And humans are not alone in this.

163
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,752
In the previous study,
there was nothing Lance could do about it,

164
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:17,012
but what if there had been?

165
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,226
It turns out

166
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,616
that capuchins simply refuse
to cooperate with other capuchins

167
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,560
who don't give them their share
after they worked together.

168
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:27,077
And refusing to work together
with another monkey

169
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:30,696
is a pretty straightforward way
of leveling the playing field.

170
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,942
Apparently, no monkey
getting anything at all

171
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:36,387
is better than another
monkey getting more.

172
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,950
But much like you and your coworker,

173
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:41,946
they're perfectly happy
with a little short-term inequality

174
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,478
as long as everything evens out
over the long run.

175
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:48,549
This economic connection
between fairness and cooperation

176
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,415
makes sense to me
as an evolutionary biologist.

177
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,599
After all,

178
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:55,260
your ancestors didn't get
to pass on their genes

179
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,998
because they did well
in some absolute sense,

180
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,814
but because they did better than others.

181
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,776
We don't call it survival of the fit,

182
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,815
we call it survival of the fittest.

183
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,291
As in more fit than others.

184
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,755
It's all relative.

185
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,728
OK.

186
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,815
So my capuchins don't like it
when they get less than another.

187
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,506
And they're perfectly happy
to sacrifice their cucumbers

188
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,871
to level the playing field.

189
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,058
That's great.

190
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,385
But what we would call
a sense of fairness in humans

191
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,584
also means that we care
when we get more than someone else.

192
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,576
What about my monkeys?

193
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,901
It turns out

194
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:33,714
that primates do notice
when they get more than others,

195
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,920
or at least some of them do.

196
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:37,626
My capuchins do not.

197
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,016
But in one of my studies,

198
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,482
my chimpanzees would
sometimes refuse a grape

199
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:47,276
if another chimpanzee
in their group got a cucumber,

200
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,577
which is pretty impressive,
given how much my chimpanzees like grapes.

201
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:57,078
However, they were still more upset
when they got less than another chimp

202
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,045
as compared to when they got more.

203
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:02,172
You may not think it's fair
when you have more than your neighbor,

204
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:05,807
but you really don't think it's fair
when your neighbor has more than you.

205
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,823
Here's an important question, though.

206
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,966
Why do we care
about inequality or unfairness

207
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,760
when we are the ones
who are unfairly benefiting?

208
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,413
If evolution is about
survival of the fittest,

209
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:20,365
wouldn't it make sense to grab
any advantage you can get?

210
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,318
Here's the thing though.

211
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,056
I do better if I get more than you, sure.

212
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,155
But best of all is if you and I
can work together

213
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,568
and get more than either one of us
could have gotten on our own.

214
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:35,354
But why would you work with me
if you don't think I'm going to play fair?

215
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:38,752
But if you think I'm going to notice
when I've got more than you

216
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,307
and do something about it,

217
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,275
then you will work with me.

218
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:47,379
Evolution has selected us
to accept the occasional short-term loss

219
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:51,739
in order to maintain these all-important
long-term relationships.

220
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,006
This is true in chimpanzees,

221
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,847
but it is even more important in humans.

222
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,991
Humans are incredibly interconnected
and interdependent,

223
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:02,964
and we have the advanced
cognitive abilities

224
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,877
to be able to plan far into the future.

225
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,004
And to recognize the importance

226
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,795
of maintaining these
cooperative partnerships.

227
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,222
Indeed, if anything,

228
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,453
I think we are likely underplaying

229
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:18,282
how important the sense
of fairness is for people.

230
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:22,523
One of the biggest differences
between humans and capuchin monkeys

231
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:26,688
is the sheer magnitude and ubiquity
of cooperation in humans.

232
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:27,871
In other words,

233
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,966
we're a lot more cooperative
than capuchin monkeys are.

234
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,307
Legal and economic systems
literally only exist

235
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,839
if we all agree to participate in them.

236
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:39,514
And if people feel left out
of the rewards and benefits

237
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,688
of those systems,

238
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,093
then they stop participating,

239
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,274
and the whole system falls apart.

240
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:47,022
Many of the protests
and uprisings we're seeing,

241
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,498
both in the US and around the globe,

242
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,910
are explicitly framed
in terms of fairness,

243
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,156
which is not surprising to me.

244
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,758
Whether it's about disproportionate
access to resources,

245
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,789
or that some groups are being
disproportionately impacted

246
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,780
by the legal system
or the effects of a virus,

247
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,625
these protests are the logical outcome

248
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,624
of our long evolutionary tendency
to reject unfairness

249
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:14,467
combined with our long history
of social stratification.

250
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,189
And the systemic inequalities

251
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,705
that have resulted
from that stratification.

252
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:22,808
Layer on top of this the fact
that by many measures

253
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,673
economic inequality is skyrocketing.

254
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,556
Chris Boehm wrote a book
called "Hierarchy in the Forest,"

255
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,707
in which he argued
that humans have reverse hierarchies

256
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:36,104
in which those at the bottom band together

257
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,110
to keep those at the top
from taking advantage of them.

258
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:43,609
Perhaps these protests
are simply the latest manifestation

259
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,642
of humans' tendency
to rebalance the hierarchy.

260
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,230
Perhaps the biggest difference
between us and capuchin monkeys

261
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:52,842
is that we can recognize this problem

262
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,413
and actively work
to do something about it.

263
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,617
Of course we recognize
when we're disadvantaged.

264
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:02,219
But we can and we must also recognize

265
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:05,474
when we're advantaged
at the expense of someone else,

266
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:07,276
and recognize fairness

267
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,426
as the balance between
these two inequalities,

268
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,797
because our society
literally depends upon it.

269
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:16,859
Indeed, my research shows

270
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:21,057
that not all primate species
care about inequality.

271
00:12:21,081 --> 00:12:24,299
It's only those that rely on cooperation,

272
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:26,910
which most definitely includes humans.

273
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:29,037
We evolved to care about fairness

274
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:33,103
because we rely on each other
for our cooperative society.

275
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,096
And the more unfair the world gets,

276
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,008
and the less we care about each other,

277
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,961
the more peril we will face.

278
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:42,135
Our issues are more complex
than grapes and cucumbers,

279
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,595
but as the capuchins have taught us,

280
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:47,626
we will all do better
when we all play fair.

281
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:49,094
Thank you.
