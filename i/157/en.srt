00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,889
Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Hi, Roz Brewer.

2
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:16,785
Thanks so much for being with us today.

3
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,794
Rosalind Brewer: Thank you for having me.

4
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,300
WPR: We can just dive right in.

5
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:23,579
We're right now
in the last quarter of 2020,

6
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:27,546
and I think that a lot of people
would agree that we're in the midst

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,236
of what's probably one of the largest
reckonings around racial equity

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,520
that we've had in this country in decades.

9
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:37,372
And it's something that you've been
such a vocal advocate for,

10
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:40,015
both through your role at Starbucks

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,305
and throughout your career of diversity
and inclusion in the workplace.

12
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,664
And so I'm curious just to hear from you
to start off the conversation,

13
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:50,606
what this moment means for DEI efforts,

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,096
not just in corporate America
but in business in general.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,381
RB: You are right

16
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:59,434
that this has made many of us that are
in the corporate setting and beyond

17
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:04,744
to rethink the position on diversity
and inclusion in the workplace.

18
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:09,208
You know, let me start the conversation
about where are we actually

19
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:12,104
in diversity and inclusion
in the corporate setting,

20
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:17,102
and I will tell you that this is actually
putting a spotlight on the weaknesses

21
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:19,394
and maybe the lack of forethought

22
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:26,127
and intensity that we should always
have maintained on this subject all along.

23
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,982
One of the things that I think
it's been highlighting for most of us

24
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,864
is that our biggest
opportunity is inclusion.

25
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:39,208
Because, you know,
I have heard the stories so many times

26
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,167
about how there's
no Black talent out there,

27
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,007
no Latinx talent
for these particular roles.

28
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,663
The talent is out there.

29
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:48,669
I will tell you that it's underdeveloped,

30
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:52,520
because I think we have spent more time
trying to reach numbers

31
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,796
than we have changing our environment

32
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,967
where people feel safe,

33
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,920
where they feel they can come to work
and be their whole self,

34
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:01,439
give it everything they've got,

35
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:02,973
be their natural self

36
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,104
and be respected for it
and applauded for it,

37
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:10,094
and for people to recognize
and appreciate their differences

38
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:12,167
and understand that they're differences,

39
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,628
and if they're included
in the conversations,

40
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:18,901
that they're just a better resource
for the companies.

41
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,527
So I think there's so much opportunity
in the inclusion space,

42
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:25,089
because we focus too much
on meeting metrics.

43
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,441
WPR: And, you know,
I think earlier this year

44
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:31,481
when the protests began
right after the death of George Floyd,

45
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:36,019
we saw lots of organizations
put out these statements of solidarity,

46
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:39,827
these commitments
to do more to be inclusive

47
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,381
both in their workspace

48
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:45,072
and for their customers
and people who support their work.

49
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,580
But then you also hear --

50
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:49,615
I've heard a lot of business leaders
say things like, "You know,

51
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,550
we want to do something
but don't really know where to start."

52
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:55,983
And so I'm curious to hear from you
just sort of what do you think

53
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:59,295
are ways that you actually
can make a real difference

54
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,157
when it comes to thinking
about diversity and inclusion

55
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:06,568
and avoid sort of this
performative justice?

56
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:07,761
RB: Yes.

57
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:11,599
So there's a few things
that I think about in this space.

58
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:14,451
First of all, when you think
about an inclusive environment,

59
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:16,658
you think about: Am I being heard?

60
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:20,349
And most people with differences,

61
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:24,623
they want to know that you are heard
and that you are seen.

62
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:27,673
And I really applaud the companies
who have been spending time

63
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:30,050
just putting themselves
on a learning journey,

64
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:32,314
you know, holding listening sessions,

65
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:38,260
trying to make sure that
we've got different viewpoints

66
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,563
when big decisions are made.

67
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,110
You know, there are some companies
who are engaging their partner networks

68
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:46,090
in ways that they've never done before.

69
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:48,746
I think those are some
early success factors

70
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,286
that could lead us
to different kinds of conversations.

71
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,684
And I've been listening to
a lot of my peers in different industries,

72
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,850
and they're having
their own personal aha moments,

73
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:02,417
and they're actually checking themselves
at the front door, saying,

74
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,094
"I never thought," "I never knew,"

75
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,679
"I didn't know what I was doing
when I said X, or when I did this." Right?

76
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:12,731
And so I think it starts
with some very simple things.

77
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,108
I'd say that there are
a lot of steps to take

78
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,544
before training and development,
that's for sure.

79
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:20,998
So those that are jumping quickly
into training and development,

80
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:24,459
I'd say put a pause on it
and just get back to grassroots

81
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:26,642
and hold listening sessions
and then decide,

82
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,076
what do you want to do?

83
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,184
And then help those people
of diverse backgrounds

84
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:35,024
engage in those conversations about
how they want to see change happen.

85
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,100
They're the best resource
for a lot of this

86
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:39,816
and a lot of these discussions.

87
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,387
I mean, I learned so much.

88
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,527
I have breakfast sessions
with the baristas and partners

89
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,756
at Starbucks regularly.

90
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,800
I just had one yesterday,
and when my screen popped up,

91
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:55,012
I had nine diverse
randomly selected partners.

92
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,276
We call our employees "partners."

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,219
And it was such a rich conversation,

94
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:03,623
and they began to network
while I'm talking to them, right,

95
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,568
they were learning from each other.

96
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:07,608
And this wasn't a diversity conversation.

97
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:11,080
We were actually kicking off
our new financial year at Starbucks,

98
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,183
and so this was actually
a business conversation

99
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,668
and a touch-base to see how you're doing

100
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,584
while we're working remotely.

101
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:21,928
And, you know, it starts there
with building relationships

102
00:05:21,952 --> 00:05:26,172
and learning people for who they are
and engaging them and saying,

103
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,761
"I see you, I hear you."

104
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:33,000
That goes such a long way
that I think if we do more of that,

105
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,416
I even think the engagement
and performance

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,985
just goes through the roof.

107
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,556
WPR: And so what I hear you saying, then,
is that it's less about

108
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,897
this short-term "how can I respond
to this moment right now?"

109
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:47,847
and it's more about
long-term engagement with people

110
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:51,889
and making this part of the fabric
of how you do your work.

111
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:55,296
And so I'm curious also to hear
a little bit about,

112
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,497
just, I guess if there is a timeline,

113
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:02,868
when people think about how quickly
they should be responding to protests

114
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:07,282
and to what's happening
in this cultural moment.

115
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,666
What should we actually be looking at

116
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,616
as far as when we see this change
actually materialize and take effect?

117
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:19,144
RB: Yes. So I think there are
some short-term things.

118
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:25,842
There are some really key partnerships
in the communities around our localities

119
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:28,397
that are really important to also engage

120
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,971
in some of the listening
and learning sessions as well.

121
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:38,135
I learn tons from organizations
like the Legal Defense Fund,

122
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,576
from the NAACP,

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,259
and engaging those partnerships
that we've had over the years,

124
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,226
but changing the discussion
of the conversation

125
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,389
about how do we partner together.

126
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:51,628
Because one of the things
that I fear for being a retailer

127
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:55,312
like Starbucks and many other companies

128
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:59,868
is that I want my partners to feel
not only safe, comfortable,

129
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,609
heard and seen in the company,

130
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,831
I want them to have that same
experience in the community.

131
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:07,217
And so that's when it comes full circle.

132
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:11,969
I really want diverse BIPOC employees

133
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:15,051
to feel like, you know,
"I make a difference."

134
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,551
First of all, I vote every year.

135
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,048
I'm engaged in my community.

136
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,559
And then I'm engaged in work.

137
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,801
So I have value.

138
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,039
And so I think there are
some key partnerships

139
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,931
that should happen right now

140
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:28,624
so that we can make sure
that our employees feel like

141
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:33,950
they have a full way to engage
in this change that's underfoot right now.

142
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,510
WPR: And then I wonder, conversely,

143
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:41,616
what sort of pitfalls have you seen
business leaders fall into

144
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,229
that are actually just not effective

145
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,595
and are not supportive of efforts

146
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:49,515
to be more inclusive and to diversify?

147
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,782
What are some of the things
that haven't worked?

148
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:57,160
RB: Yeah, you know, I worry about
the race for numbers, to meet numbers,

149
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:01,226
because what you will find,
I've found many times in my career,

150
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,689
is that some of our best leaders
have good intentions,

151
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:06,067
but they don't understand.

152
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:09,203
They don't understand
the partner sitting next to them

153
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,063
that looks different from them.

154
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:13,520
And so I worry about
when we race to numbers,

155
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:15,325
because, you know what?

156
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:18,488
The kind of country we live in,
the world we live in,

157
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,298
we all know how to make numbers work.

158
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:23,803
What we don't know how to do
is to build strong relationships

159
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:26,067
that are lasting, that are valued.

160
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,105
And I think that's where we need to start,

161
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:31,317
is relationship-building
and key partnerships.

162
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:34,695
So I worry about the numbers base.

163
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:40,611
WPR: And so, of course, I think
we all remember a few years back,

164
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,962
Starbucks had a very public issue.

165
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:46,436
You were embroiled
in that incident in Philadelphia

166
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,822
around racial discrimination

167
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:53,065
that led to Starbucks taking a step back
and thinking about inclusion

168
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,872
and implicit bias and racial sensitivity.

169
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:01,670
So how did that experience
help prepare you for this year,

170
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:06,593
both as an individual business leader
and then also as an organization?

171
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:09,906
How did it help you approach
what we've been experiencing

172
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,834
in this country in the past few months?

173
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:15,665
RB: So, that was
a real example of leadership

174
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:21,583
and, actually, where Starbucks had failed
in selecting the right leadership

175
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,472
for that store.

176
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,990
And to give you an example,

177
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,839
the person that was running that store

178
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:32,392
was a very young, up-and-coming
leader for the company,

179
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:37,985
and to put her in a store
in 18th and Spruce in Philadelphia

180
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,779
was an opportunity for all of us.

181
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:45,251
So in retrospect, one of the reasons
why we did the antibias training

182
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,752
was to make sure that
we began those conversations.

183
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,785
And when I talk
about not just training --

184
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,973
that training was very unique
because it was self-engaged.

185
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,372
They weren't being
taught by an instructor.

186
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,399
They had to have conversations
with their peer baristas

187
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:04,262
around diversity and inclusion
amongst themselves.

188
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:07,323
So it wasn't moderated
by any leader in the company.

189
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,819
It was self-instructive.

190
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,519
And the conversations that were created

191
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:16,211
once we had that kind
of relationship-building --

192
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:18,531
you know, we had
some of our baristas asking us,

193
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,628
"Can I take this home
and talk to my father,

194
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,004
who never let me take
the Black girl to the prom?"

195
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:27,932
You know, we started what we felt
like a movement and a discussion

196
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:32,166
that we have been able
to really use from that point on

197
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,992
in terms of the way we want
to escalate the conversations

198
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,815
and make change happen at Starbucks,

199
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,170
and not only at Starbucks
but in our communities,

200
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:43,334
because there were quite a few
organizations that we reached out to

201
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:46,257
that we're still engaged with today

202
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:50,166
that are helping us build
community leadership as well.

203
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:52,426
WPR: And is that the goal?

204
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,046
I mean, you mentioning an employee
who wanted to take their learnings home.

205
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,828
Is the goal in thinking about how you
approach these issues as an organization

206
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,511
for your employees and your partners

207
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:07,679
to see how they can move this
beyond just their work life?

208
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:11,129
RB: Sure. You know,
a lot of this starts at home.

209
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,015
It starts with what happens
at your dinner table. Right?

210
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,664
And so we can correct what happens
and we're responsible for what happens

211
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,839
when you come to work at Starbucks,

212
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:25,924
but we also realize that
we can only get them ever so far,

213
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:28,424
but if you're at the table
having some conversations

214
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:31,206
that are counter to what
you're learning in the workplace,

215
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,942
you can't help but slow down
your growth and your change.

216
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:38,392
And so a lot of the work that we do
around diversity and inclusion

217
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,706
is open-sourced.

218
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,841
So when we created
the materials for the work

219
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:46,950
when we had the closing
of our stores on May 28th,

220
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:51,163
we had given that to so many
other companies for them to use,

221
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:56,363
and even we're doing some work right now
around Courageous Conversations.

222
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,534
And in this remote world,

223
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:02,457
we're allowing our partners
to bring their families onto the camera

224
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:03,664
or listen in the room

225
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:06,292
as we have courageous
conversations on diversity.

226
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:11,585
So if Starbucks has a keynote speaker
on a certain diversity topic,

227
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:13,054
we invite the family in.

228
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,136
And it's been really, it's been great.

229
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,988
A lot of our senior executives have said,

230
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:22,193
"This is starting new conversations
with my teens at home,"

231
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,296
who are either getting bullied ...

232
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,457
These are changing the conversations
about why we question

233
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,002
some of the actions
that we had around our house.

234
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:35,326
And so we need to understand
that to embrace this issue,

235
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,497
it is not as small as numbers,

236
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,561
it's not as small as just the workplace.

237
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:42,579
It is very comprehensive.

238
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:45,056
So we're trying to do
something different here

239
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,264
to change the conversations
and then actually grow inclusion

240
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,175
in a very, very grassroots way

241
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,958
at Starbucks.

242
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:56,907
WPR: And, of course, I would imagine
as a Black woman and a business leader

243
00:12:56,931 --> 00:13:00,480
that these issues hit
really close to home for you.

244
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:03,512
And I'm curious just
with your interactions

245
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:06,830
with colleagues and counterparts
at other organizations

246
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,398
that perhaps there isn't
that same level of investment

247
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:13,672
because it isn't something
that's as important personally.

248
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:18,706
And I'm curious how you are able
to begin those conversations

249
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,434
with colleagues and counterparts

250
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,101
who are in positions to bring
about this sort of change

251
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,398
in their own organizations

252
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,880
or within Starbucks.

253
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,102
How do you get them invested,

254
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:31,339
and how do you, frankly,
get them to care about this?

255
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,255
RB: Yeah, that's a very good question.

256
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,815
So, I have two children.

257
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,791
I have a daughter who is 17
and a son who is 25.

258
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:41,321
And quite honestly,
when that situation happened

259
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:44,748
in our Starbucks stores back in 2018,

260
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:48,064
my son was the same
exact age as Donte and Rashon

261
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,098
and looks a lot like them, by the way,

262
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,253
and would have been sitting
in the Starbucks

263
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:53,766
dressed the same way they were.

264
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,665
So that incident alone
was deeply personal to me,

265
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,855
actually made me grab my chest, right?

266
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,622
Because I knew at any given moment

267
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:04,511
my husband or my son
could get pulled over,

268
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,884
and I'd get that call
in the middle of the night.

269
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:09,046
So it's deeply personal for me,

270
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,860
and what I try to do is I share stories,

271
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,505
and I talk very openly about my family
and what we do on the weekends

272
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,704
and our holiday traditions
and all of those things.

273
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:21,544
And I have no issue
with someone leaning over to me,

274
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,308
maybe one of my white counterparts,

275
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:26,329
saying, "I don't understand that.
What are they talking about?"

276
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:30,464
when they hear something that's
a little bit different than their culture.

277
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:34,010
And I'm wide open to explain
and have those conversations,

278
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:38,394
because I feel like I really want
to be a conduit for that.

279
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:41,991
I always tell everyone,
no question's too small or too big.

280
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,316
Even with everything
that's going on right now

281
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,505
in our environment around social unrest,

282
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,872
I've gotten tons of calls
from my white peers at different companies

283
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,438
saying, "Roz, what do you think?
What are you hearing?

284
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,616
Help me out here."

285
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,793
I'll drop everything,

286
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,081
because if I can help,
and I'll tell the story,

287
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:03,143
and I think most people know
if they've known me over the years.

288
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,688
I'm pretty frank and outspoken.

289
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:07,246
And I'll also tell them
when they've really messed up

290
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,971
and what they need to do about it.

291
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:13,135
And so I think I want more Black leaders

292
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,664
to feel just as confident in doing that.

293
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,491
I see no risk in it.

294
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:22,685
I do realize that it begins
a new relationship with some people,

295
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:25,191
and some people can't take
the tough conversations,

296
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,951
but it's time for tough conversations.

297
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:29,520
WPR: And, I mean, to that point,

298
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,645
I imagine there are probably
also people who,

299
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,306
because these conversations
are tough and uncomfortable,

300
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,295
think maybe it's easier or better
to just avoid having to do that

301
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,144
and to have those
conversations and discussions

302
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:43,873
to stir the pot in some ways.

303
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:45,816
And so what do you say to the people

304
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,592
who think "Let's just try to lay low,"

305
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,908
and I've heard some of this, too,
in this moment, "Let the moment pass

306
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,422
so that we can get back
to business as usual"?

307
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:58,506
RB: Yeah. Well, I'd first start off
by saying how disgusted I am

308
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,311
by that statement,

309
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,824
because leaders lead in the moment,

310
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:06,467
and you never know when
you're going to be called upon.

311
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,353
And if this isn't a calling,

312
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,556
I don't know what is.

313
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,689
And so when I get that call and say,

314
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:14,150
"You know, I just think
I should take the back seat

315
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:18,021
and just kind of let this brew here
and that calm down,"

316
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:21,973
you know, we need to all --
it's an all-in moment.

317
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:26,298
And leadership is not
designated by your title.

318
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:30,306
It's designated about how great
you can create followership.

319
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,267
And having thought leadership,

320
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,083
people underestimate the opportunity

321
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:41,283
to pick up the phone and call someone,
and say, "How are you?

322
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:44,155
How is this affecting you?
How can I help?"

323
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,600
That's pretty simple.

324
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:48,030
You might decide it's something
I can't help with,

325
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,117
but you'd better darn sure
pick up the phone

326
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,029
and start feeling out the environment

327
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,238
in your employee base,
in your peers, in your leaders,

328
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:59,460
because the time is now,
and so I don't give them an out.

329
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:03,431
I actually try and push them
over the edge,

330
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,975
because sometimes they are
just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"

331
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:10,613
And then the other thing
that I personally have to do

332
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,397
is to make sure that they understand

333
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:14,927
that because I am
at this level where I am,

334
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,160
I'm not excluded from these issues, right?

335
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:21,404
I know that when my husband
jumps in his vehicle,

336
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:24,213
I worry every time
if he's out in the evening

337
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:26,993
that he may not come back home
the same way he left.

338
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:29,738
I feel that way for my son
and for my husband.

339
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:32,923
I still get, even when I go shopping,

340
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:36,387
I still get the look, am I stealing,

341
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,573
watching me as I walk around the corner.

342
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:42,448
And I don't know what else or how else
I can look or act any different,

343
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:43,933
so I just act like myself.

344
00:17:43,957 --> 00:17:47,055
I used to get dressed to go shopping.

345
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,539
Now I never do that.

346
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,930
If I'm spending my money,
my money spends everywhere,

347
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:55,575
and if I get that feeling that you're
going to race me around the store,

348
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,760
then I'm going to leave,
and that's your loss.

349
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:00,792
But I still get that, and so I worry.

350
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:07,207
So I also try to help people understand
that this is not a socioeconomic,

351
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,386
once you've sort of "made it,"
you're out of the water.

352
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,570
No.

353
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:17,913
We're still, as someone with differences,
visible differences, you're still at risk.

354
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,101
WPR: And so much of this
conversation also is about

355
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,878
who's in leadership
and who's making these decisions

356
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:29,667
and representation at high levels.

357
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,352
And I know that you've been really vocal
about your own experiences

358
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:37,149
as a woman color, person of color,
as a Black woman,

359
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:40,371
in these executive positions,

360
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:45,032
and often feeling you are
the only one in some rooms,

361
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,764
and sort of the isolation of that,

362
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:52,000
but also the challenges in making choices
and getting things done

363
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,382
when that's the case.

364
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,188
And so I'm curious also,

365
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:58,179
what are the opportunities
that this moment presents

366
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,361
for us to perhaps
approach this differently,

367
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:04,050
and how can people
at different organizations

368
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:08,397
who are looking to bring people in
to positions of leadership,

369
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:11,825
how can we approach this differently
so that we can begin to see

370
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,286
more people of color in these roles?

371
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,461
RB: Sure.

372
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,156
It's been my experience

373
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:23,015
that I see tons of great, diverse talent
coming in to companies,

374
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,038
and then they're stuck.

375
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:29,601
And what I see is the pipeline
is very weak at a certain level,

376
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:34,705
and once it gets to the point
of trying to decide on a succession plan

377
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:37,157
for who's next in line for the big jobs,

378
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:40,881
there's this great talent
that's like that mid-level manager area,

379
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:42,169
then there's a big gap,

380
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:44,335
and then there's maybe two at the top.

381
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,090
And it puts a lot of pressure
on those two on the top

382
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:49,668
to try and go down and grab
those that are just,

383
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,651
maybe been with the company
for two to five years,

384
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,219
and lift them up.

385
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,843
So what I think about is:

386
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:59,118
How do we give extraordinary experiences

387
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:01,879
to our youngest diverse talent

388
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:04,873
so that they can get
that exposure early on

389
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:08,790
and begin to develop early on
just like their white peers?

390
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:12,078
And I think sometimes
we celebrate too much

391
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,674
that they are part of the company,

392
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:18,218
but what we need to celebrate is,
where is their progression?

393
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,193
Where is their opportunity for growth?

394
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,408
Who's listening to them,

395
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:23,242
and who has their hands on them?

396
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:27,433
And one of the things
that we're doing at Starbucks

397
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:30,423
is really having structured mentorship.

398
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:35,783
But the mentorship looks a lot more
like being a sponsor.

399
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:42,548
And so, our executive leaders
will be responsible for the development

400
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,033
of our young, diverse talent

401
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:48,648
and making sure that they're getting
that exposure and those opportunities.

402
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:51,840
And just imagine if you're
a new hire in the company,

403
00:20:51,864 --> 00:20:55,957
and someone wants to meet with you
at a senior level once a month,

404
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:57,397
twice a year, even --

405
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:58,594
that's game-changing.

406
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:03,188
And so we have to reach
our young talent early,

407
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:06,027
and now this pipeline has got to close.

408
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,575
We've got to fill it up

409
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,857
and close this gap,

410
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:11,409
because if not, I don't see a pathway

411
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:15,394
for diverse executives,
C-suite executives,

412
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:18,492
in the next, I would say,
three to five years,

413
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:21,176
I don't see a lot of placements happening.

414
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,744
WPR: And are you hopeful in this moment?

415
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:28,508
Do you feel like we are
making progress towards this?

416
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,396
RB: It's early days.

417
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,777
I'm hopeful.

418
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:38,294
I feel good about the conversations
that are happening.

419
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:44,475
I'm seeing change in people
thinking more about themselves

420
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:49,790
when my white counterparts
are questioning some of their actions.

421
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:54,067
And so I feel like we can't
let this moment leave us,

422
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:55,751
and what we're learning about it.

423
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:59,120
I think what I'm really optimistic about

424
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:02,842
is that now I think
more people will understand

425
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:07,049
that the less diverse
and less inclusive we are,

426
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:09,722
it's more than a business imperative.

427
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,207
When we combine the pandemic

428
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:15,598
and we see the inequities of a pandemic

429
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:17,516
on a diverse community,

430
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,764
and we talk about how that happens,

431
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:23,751
how people are underrepresented
in health care,

432
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,747
underrepresented in their housing,

433
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,994
they can see that this
is a groundswell moment.

434
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:34,488
And the more we realize that
and talk about that complexity,

435
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:36,467
then the solutions begin to happen.

436
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:39,064
And I think that's happening
more and more,

437
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:40,736
so I'm optimistic about that,

438
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,059
because we're looking at the ills
of lack of diversity and inclusion,

439
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,048
and maybe looking
at much broader solutions for it

440
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:51,840
than what we have in the past.

441
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:55,795
WPR: Thank you so much, Roz.
This was such a meaningful conversation.

442
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:57,500
It was great to hear your insights.

443
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,134
RB: Thank you.
