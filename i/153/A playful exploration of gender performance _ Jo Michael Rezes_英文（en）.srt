00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,093
(Music: "La Vie en Rose")

3
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:31,519
Cecily: Ah, well,
I feel rather frightened.

4
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,385
I'm so afraid he will look
just like everyone else.

5
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,861
(Algernon sniffs)

6
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:39,869
C: He does.

7
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:43,234
Algernon: You are my little
cousin Cecily, I'm sure.

8
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,577
C: You are under some grave mistake.

9
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm not little.

10
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:50,863
In fact, I do believe I'm actually
more than usually tall for my age.

11
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,735
But I am your cousin Cecily,

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,776
and you, I see, are also here
helping Jo Michael Rezes

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,592
with their TEDx talk.

14
00:00:57,616 --> 00:01:03,260
And you are my cousin Ernest,
my wicked cousin Ernest.

15
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:06,593
A: Oh! Well, I'm not really
wicked at all, cousin Cecily.

16
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:08,299
You mustn't think that I am wicked.

17
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,965
C: Well, I hope you haven't
been leading a double life,

18
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,309
pretending to be good
and being really wicked all the time.

19
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,760
That would be hypocrisy.

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,125
A: Well, of course,
I have been rather reckless.

21
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,769
C: I am glad to hear it.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,063
A: But the world is good enough
for me, cousin Cecily.

23
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,634
C: Yes, but are you good enough for it?

24
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:29,602
A: I'm afraid I am not that.

25
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,571
That's why I want you to reform me.

26
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,989
C: Well, I'm afraid
I have no time this afternoon.

27
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:36,203
The TED talk and all.

28
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,403
(Laughter)

29
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:40,366
A: Well, would you mind
my reforming myself this afternoon?

30
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,339
C: Oh, that's rather quixotic of you,

31
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,815
but I think you should try.

32
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:46,064
A: Good. I feel better already.

33
00:01:46,088 --> 00:01:47,737
C: You're looking a little worse.

34
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,403
A: Well, might I have that pink rose?

35
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,578
C: Why?

36
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:55,197
A: Because you are
like a pink rose, cousin Cecily.

37
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:57,502
C: Well, I don't think
it could be right for you

38
00:01:57,526 --> 00:01:58,694
to talk to me like that.

39
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,351
A: You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.

40
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,581
C: But -- well, I -- I --

41
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,513
A: And, and ahem --

42
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:09,616
C: All good looks are a snare and --

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,238
A: Well, it's a snare
that every sensible man

44
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,283
would like to be caught in, and ...

45
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:16,402
Jo Michael Rezes: (Sighs)

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,184
I'm so sorry, I um --

47
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,259
I didn't finish rehearsing.

48
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,028
Um, well it's not because
I can't walk in heels,

49
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,635
I'm actually really good at that,

50
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,492
and I can prove it to you, too,
but I really am sorry.

51
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:34,881
Hold on.

52
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:38,445
Uh, um.

53
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:42,405
No matter.

54
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:44,056
No matter.

55
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,024
Right.

56
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,855
Right, introductions.

57
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,559
It's a TEDx talk. Right.

58
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:53,332
Hi, there! (Laughs) Um.

59
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,830
My name is Jo Michael Rezes,

60
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:59,763
and I'm a PhD student here
in theater and performance studies.

61
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,204
And I specialize in the study
of queer identities

62
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:06,410
as they maneuver and affect
the perceptions of time

63
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:08,234
in the performance of camp.

64
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,700
You know camp?

65
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:15,186
Sincerity in irony's clothing?

66
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,599
Making the kitsch feel like home?

67
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:18,774
No?

68
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,149
The Met Gala theme from 2019

69
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:23,685
that was thoroughly misunderstood
by over 95 percent of its attendees?

70
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:24,719
(Laughter)

71
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:25,895
No? OK, anyway.

72
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,754
I'm also an actor-director
and theater educator at large

73
00:03:28,778 --> 00:03:30,109
in the greater Boston area.

74
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,188
Oh, and where are my manners?

75
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,140
The friends I brought with me today
are Algernon and Cecily

76
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,640
from Oscar Wilde's famously
well-known play,

77
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:39,656
"The Importance of Being Earnest."

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,306
And they'll be back, don't worry.

79
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,902
I've only scared them off a bit.

80
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:44,130
And let's be honest,

81
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,349
it wouldn't be a TEDx talk

82
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:48,965
without things wrapping up nicely
at the end, would it?

83
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,139
(Laughter)

84
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:54,380
You know, I hope
that wasn't too awful, though.

85
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:56,817
It was awkward, I know, to watch me fail.

86
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,714
To fail at what, exactly, though?

87
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:03,633
To play a man and a woman
at the same time?

88
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:06,585
I mean, to play a man and a woman
when I'm actually neither?

89
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:11,363
Why does it feel so awkward
when we see someone fail at gender,

90
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,772
and why do we care?

91
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:16,033
I mean, obviously, me screwing this up
was done on purpose.

92
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,343
Obviously, I had this all
perfectly memorized

93
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,498
and rehearsed for today, right?

94
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:21,704
Right?

95
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,729
(Laughter)

96
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:26,210
Well, I'm here today to talk about
gender performativity

97
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:28,805
and the ways in which I've used
my acting classroom

98
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:32,847
as a space to disrupt the finality
of gender performance,

99
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:37,170
to open up a looser space
for thinking about gender identity

100
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,368
through supportive failure,

101
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,542
generous mistakes
and honest communication.

102
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,820
We all, actors or otherwise,

103
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:47,864
can play with gender
in our everyday lives.

104
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,237
And I call this "gender rehearsativity."

105
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:55,872
Now, before all of the queer theorists
and women's studies degree holders

106
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,930
and Judith Butler fanatics in the audience

107
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:02,771
start to tear the half-and-half,
hyperbinary costume off of my body,

108
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:04,887
let me first explain where popular culture

109
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,188
has already begun to misunderstand
gender performativity,

110
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:11,910
before I move into
the rehearsativity I hold so dear.

111
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,459
Now, as an educator

112
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:17,640
and as a youngish
20-something-year-old trans person,

113
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,977
I'm constantly hearing from my
20-something-year-old students,

114
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,163
friends and colleagues

115
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,441
that gender is "over" --

116
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:27,727
that gender is so fluid and carefree

117
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:31,933
and that society, film and television
are so inclusive of transgender people,

118
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,395
that it's basically over.

119
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,434
Now, I don't ascribe to the binary,
as a nonbinary person myself.

120
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:41,521
But gender definitely isn't over.

121
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,593
Or, at least I don't think it is.

122
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:49,570
And maybe, just maybe,
gender is always beginning.

123
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:51,586
This last semester,

124
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,006
at roughly 10:23am,

125
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,355
two of my acting students,

126
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,791
while embodying delicious caricatures
of fraternity brothers --

127
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,172
forgive me, I don't remember
his or his name --

128
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,039
well, they rounded up the class,

129
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,507
and these two women in snapbacks
and baggy clothing

130
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:12,673
slacked their mouths to reveal lax jaws
and lax bro mentalities.

131
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,240
And, astounding as it was to watch,

132
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:22,720
these women fluctuated
between irony and satire,

133
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:27,942
the uncanny and the ruthlessly so,
pain and joy, until ultimately

134
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,904
they failed to be the men
they were choosing to embody.

135
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:33,380
They simply stopped talking.

136
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:35,393
Silence.

137
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,593
A lull hit the class,

138
00:06:36,617 --> 00:06:39,807
and time seemed to be
sucked clean out of the room.

139
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,752
And in this moment of loud stillness,

140
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:43,938
one of the women,

141
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:49,122
still using her frat bro voice
though fully out of character,

142
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:50,730
said, nearly in a whisper,

143
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,409
(In frat bro voice)
"Gender is a social construct."

144
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,176
(Laughter)

145
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,962
I'll admit: I laughed along
with my students that morning,

146
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:04,557
partially at the comedic timing
that my student had in her delivery

147
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:09,570
but also at the fact that society
has turned gender performativity

148
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,486
into gender as social construct.

149
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,110
Now, listen to this:

150
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:18,688
I think that this idea has come
from renowned queer studies scholar

151
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:19,863
Judith Butler,

152
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,468
whose seminal work
in the performativity of gender

153
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,133
has gone on to be a staple

154
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:27,410
in undergraduate classrooms
at liberal arts institutions.

155
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:30,132
Now, this SparkNotes version
of Butler's work

156
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:35,918
is found in the idea that gender exists
in repeated words and actions.

157
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:39,114
And these performatives create
and are created

158
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:41,418
by the bodies of real human beings.

159
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,633
Now, listen to this:

160
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:45,268
"Moreover, in a 1988 essay,

161
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:51,394
Butler claims that gender is an act
which has been rehearsed.

162
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,212
In this way,

163
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:57,831
gender through repetition
becomes a recognizable script,

164
00:07:57,855 --> 00:08:01,089
which requires actors to reproduce it."

165
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,264
Huh.

166
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:07,181
Much like my attempt
at "The Importance of Being Earnest."

167
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:09,117
Ooh, I mean -- look at my costume.

168
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:13,169
(In a deep voice) Why does this half
make me feel manly, masculine, suave,

169
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,954
(In a high voice) and this half makes me
feel girly, fabulous and feminine?

170
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,330
I mean, some of us even forget
that gender is there,

171
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:23,391
because it is so well-rehearsed
into our bodies.

172
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,978
But there's always an ideal of gender
that we can never quite achieve.

173
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,750
But it's up to us to play with it.

174
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,720
Now, I've played with gender
throughout my own career as an actor,

175
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:37,142
and in one semester
as an undergraduate student,

176
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,992
I was cast in two roles simultaneously:

177
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:42,297
Brad Majors in "The Rocky Horror Show,"

178
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,785
and Charlotte Ivanovna
in "The Cherry Orchard."

179
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,492
One man, one woman and one me.

180
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:52,707
I would go from one rehearsal,

181
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,954
playing the manly, aggressive Brad,

182
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:58,940
only to be pulled,
moments later, into a wig

183
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:03,823
and delicately blended eyeliner
as Charlotte, a German governess.

184
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:07,006
The constant push and pull
of these identities

185
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,387
was not only invaluable
to my work as an actor,

186
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:14,164
attempting to span the spectrum
of gender in my work,

187
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,871
but it also revealed to me

188
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:18,196
that my own queer identities

189
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,418
are deeply indebted to embodying
the extremes of gender.

190
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:26,910
These characters held important
facets of my identities,

191
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,339
of my body,

192
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:29,848
my daily pain,

193
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:32,807
of my social interactions, of my memories,

194
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:37,736
and rehearsing these characters
allowed me to explore those identities,

195
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,212
which has opened up my need
as an acting teacher

196
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,656
to show the importance
of playing with gender in rehearsal.

197
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:48,088
So when I present to you all

198
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,263
(In a high voice) Cecily

199
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,858
and (In a deep voice) Algernon,

200
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,956
there are these parts
of these two characters that I respect,

201
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,530
understand implicitly,

202
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,422
oppressions I can relate to,
fears I can embody,

203
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,979
aggressive tendencies
that I try to forget.

204
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,418
But there are also
plenty of characteristics

205
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:08,434
with which I have no personal experience,

206
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,049
nothing I can draw from.

207
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:13,706
And sometimes in a flurry of rehearsal,

208
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,181
of reading a script,

209
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,745
of creating a character,

210
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:19,525
well ... we make a mistake.

211
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,247
Algernon's aggressive
flirtation towards Cecily

212
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,660
doesn't sit well in my body,

213
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:28,372
or Cecily's calm demeanor
as written by Oscar Wilde,

214
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,108
just doesn't sit right,

215
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:31,812
and I literally trip up.

216
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:34,949
Now, this TEDx talk is a performance

217
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:38,711
in front of so many people.

218
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,925
And it differs quite drastically
from my classrooms in that regard.

219
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,043
But there is such a recognizable
pressure in our daily lives

220
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,201
to perform our gender,

221
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:49,488
our selves,

222
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:51,591
on a stage like this.

223
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,156
Quite frankly,

224
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,572
failure to pass as a man
or a woman effectively

225
00:10:57,596 --> 00:11:00,854
is still dangerous for transgender
and gender nonconforming people.

226
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,870
And listen to this:

227
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:06,149
according to the 2015
US Transgender Survey,

228
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,298
nearly half of respondents voiced

229
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,848
that they had been verbally
harassed in the past year

230
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:13,459
because of their gender
identity or expression.

231
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:17,039
And that number is shown
only to increase in communities of color.

232
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,419
Many of us now claim to view gender
on a spectrum -- and that's great --

233
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:26,214
including 60 percent
of Generation Z individuals

234
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,737
who reported to the Pew
Research Center in 2019

235
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:32,163
that they believe forms with boxes
for "male" or "female"

236
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:34,147
should include more gender options.

237
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,458
But in spite of this,

238
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:40,528
there is still latent fear
of making gender mistakes

239
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,933
in offices, in classrooms,

240
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,504
in the eyes of the government,

241
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,266
in romantic situations,

242
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,123
and for some of us,

243
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,880
even in the mirror
when we wake up in the morning.

244
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:56,044
But our gender mistakes
have the potential for something good.

245
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:57,950
Even in the binary,

246
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:00,371
approaching life on the stage
as a man or a woman,

247
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:03,371
we can support each other
in experimentation,

248
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:04,655
trips and stumbles,

249
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,672
two-hour-long meditations on

250
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:09,006
or five-second costume
changes with gender.

251
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,045
And failure is a key part

252
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:13,522
of Judith Butler's theory
of performativity.

253
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,799
But I do believe that for most people,

254
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:17,177
like you all out there,

255
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:21,386
you might hear "performativity"
and hear "perform."

256
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,050
That's to say, performance-ready

257
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,121
or if not performance-ready,

258
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:30,355
perhaps performance in general
gives you anxiety.

259
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,876
Or the stage fright that I have
to this very day.

260
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:38,201
What we need to understand
is that failing at gender

261
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:42,384
can and should be a positive,
generative process.

262
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,956
The mistakes we make with gender
can only help us grow

263
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,541
and better understand the multitudes
of gender around us.

264
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:52,465
But we need to make space
for these mistakes.

265
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,421
We need to hold space for failure.

266
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:59,146
And that's where rehearsativity
comes into play.

267
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:03,463
Now, one of the main points
I like to make with my acting students

268
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:07,125
when they're last-minute panicking
about a monologue or a scene,

269
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:10,331
is that no one is ever actually ready.

270
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:14,369
I mean, we're never actually
done rehearsing,

271
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,099
we're just put in front of an audience.

272
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:20,718
When I taught a workshop
on gender-bending this last summer

273
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,662
at Somerville Arts for Youth,

274
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:26,057
I made it quite clear
to a group of middle school-aged students

275
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,686
that you cannot be a bully
and a good actor at the same time.

276
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:31,444
It's impossible.

277
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:34,002
There is something
about the act of embodiment

278
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:37,083
that requires empathy to survive.

279
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,494
Bullying prohibits the creative process.

280
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,828
As these middle schoolers
moved about the room,

281
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:48,859
trying on the extremes
of binary gender presentation,

282
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,783
this dissolved into galumphing,

283
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,117
laughter,

284
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:59,795
parodying of stereotypes
they see in movies and on television,

285
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,297
joy in the failure to understand gender.

286
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:08,081
Even my college students,
in "Introduction to Acting,"

287
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:11,210
jumped on the opportunity
to play with gender

288
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:13,172
when I restricted their time to think.

289
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:14,371
On Halloween last year,

290
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,625
I asked my students
to come to class in costume

291
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:21,450
and to, well, to throw their hats
into the middle of a circle,

292
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,323
metaphorically and literally,

293
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:24,992
and the only rule of the game

294
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,743
was that they had to go
into the center of the circle,

295
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,585
take on a hat, pick a character,

296
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,125
and then switch.

297
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,093
No time to think.

298
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:36,150
And it wasn't until two men in the class

299
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,626
noticed no one running
to the center of the circle

300
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,396
that they jumped into the center,

301
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,925
and one became

302
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,831
(In a deep voice) a British chauvinist,

303
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:47,479
(In a high voice) and the other,
a high-pitched, coy British lady.

304
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:52,704
Time stood still.

305
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,010
Laughter,

306
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,319
mimicry,

307
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:58,081
joy, again,

308
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,787
in the failure to understand gender.

309
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:05,190
That's the potential
of gender rehearsativity.

310
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,128
And I challenge you all

311
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,822
to think of your days as mini-rehearsals.

312
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:17,317
Cultivate spaces in your life
to explore gender.

313
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:21,190
And allow other people
to explore their gender.

314
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,007
Fail at gender.

315
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:27,182
I wish I could give you more tangible ways
to go out and do this.

316
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:30,765
But gender is funny like that.

317
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:37,091
Gender is an act which has been rehearsed.

318
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,628
Some acts more rehearsed
than others. (Laughs)

319
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,146
But gender is far from being perfect.

320
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,444
And sometimes,

321
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:50,833
just like in rehearsal,

322
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:55,664
when we support each other
in times of play,

323
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,365
in times of joy and times of pain,

324
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:05,003
we wind up succeeding more
than if we hadn't tried or failed at all.

325
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:10,214
A: Well, I think
that has been a great success.

326
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,095
I'm in love with Cecily,
and that is everything.

327
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,722
But I must see her before I go.

328
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,284
Oh, there she is.

329
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:23,109
C: Oh, I merely came back
to water the roses.

330
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,228
I thought we were at a TEDx talk with Jo.

331
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,442
A: Oh.

332
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:30,222
Well, they've gone to order
the dogcart for me.

333
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,910
C: Oh.

334
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,093
Are they going to take you
for a nice drive?

335
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,466
A: They're going to send me away.

336
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,704
C: Oh.

337
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,482
So we have to part.

338
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,299
A: I'm afraid so.

339
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:43,426
It's a very painful parting.

340
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:49,107
C: Well, the absence of old friends
one can endure with equanimity.

341
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:52,524
But even a momentary separation

342
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:56,317
from anyone whom they've just met

343
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,941
is almost unbearable.

344
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,748
JMR: Thank you.

345
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:11,499
(Applause)
